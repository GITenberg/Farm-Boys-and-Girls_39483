<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the preparation of this book I have had in
mind two classes of readers; namely, the rural
parents and the many persons who are interested in
carrying forward the rural work discussed in the
several chapters. It has been my aim to give as
much specific aid and direction as possible. The
first two chapters constitute a mere outline of some
of the fundamental principles of child development.
It would be fortunate if the reader who is unfamiliar
with such principles could have a course of
reading in the volumes that treat them extensively.
Nearly every suggestion given in the main body of
the book is based on what has already either been
undertaken with a degree of success or planned for
in some rural community.</p>

<p>I am very greatly indebted to the following persons
and firms for their kindness and generosity in
lending pictures and cuts for illustrating the book:
E. T. Fairchild, State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, Topeka, Kansas; J. W. Crabtree,
Principal State Normal School, River Falls, Wisconsin;
George W. Brown, Superintendent of Edgar
County, Paris, Illinois; O. J. Kern, Superintendent
of Winnebago County, Rockford, Illinois; Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Jessie Fields, Superintendent of Page County, Clarinda,
Iowa; A. D. Holloway, General Secretary,
County Y.M.C.A., Marysville, Kansas; Dr. Myron
T. Scudder, of Rutgers College; Doubleday, Page
&amp; Company, Garden City, New York; <i>Rural Manhood</i>,
New York City; <i>The Farmer&#8217;s Voice</i>, Chicago,
Illinois; <i>The American Agriculturist</i>, New York City;
<i>The Oklahoma Farmer</i>, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
<i>The Inland Farmer</i>, Lexington, Kentucky; <i>The
Farmer&#8217;s Advocate</i>, Winnipeg, Canada.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due <i>Successful Farming</i>, of
Des Moines, Iowa, for permission to use excerpts
from President Kirk&#8217;s article on the model school,
and portions of a series of brief articles written for
the same magazine by myself.</p>

<p>The references given at the close of the chapters
have been selected with considerable care. It will
be found in nearly every case that they give helpful
and more extended discussions of the several
topics treated in the preceding chapter.</p>

<h2>FARM BOYS AND GIRLS</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<i>BUILDING A GOOD LIFE</i></h3>


<p>If you were about to begin the construction of a
dwelling house, what questions would most likely
be uppermost in your mind? If this house were
intended for your own use, you would doubtless
consider among other important matters those of
comfort, convenience of arrangement, attractiveness
of appearance, strength, and durableness. The great
variety of dwellings to be seen on every hand is
outwardly expressive of the great variety of ideals
in the minds of the people who construct them. No
matter what means there may be available for the
purpose, it may be said that he who builds a house
thereby illustrates in concrete form his inner character.</p>

<p>With practically the same quality of materials,
one man will construct a house apparently with the
thought that its chief purpose is to be looked at.
Much work and expense will be put upon outer
show and embellishment, while in its inner arrangements
it may be exceedingly cramped and thoughtlessly
put together. Another will erect his building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
with a thought of placing it on the market. Cheap
workmanship, weak and faulty joinings, and the like,
will be concealed by some thin covering meant to
last until a profitable sale has been made and some
innocent purchaser caught with a mere shell of a
house in his possession. Occasionally, however,
there is found a man whose plans conform to such
ideals as those first named.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">What is a good life?</span></h4>

<p>As with the construction of a house, so it is in
some measure with the building of a character.
Some lives apparently are constructed to look at;
that is, with the thought that outer adornment
and a mere appearance of worth and beauty constitute
the essential qualities. Other lives are, in a
sense, made to sell. Not infrequently parents are
found developing their boys and girls as if the chief
purpose were to place them somewhere or other in
the best possible money market. A life is worth
only as much as it will bring in dollars and cents, is
apparently the predominating thought of such persons.
And then, occasionally, a life is built to <i>live
in</i>; that is, with the idea that intrinsic worth constitutes
the essential nature of the ideal character.</p>

<p>But what <i>is</i> a good life? And why is not this
precisely the question for all parents to ask themselves
at the time they begin the development of the
lives of their own boys and girls? Assuming a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
fairly sound physical and mental inheritance on the
part of the child and the given environment as the
raw materials of construction, what ideals should
parents have uppermost in mind before undertaking
the tremendously important and interesting duties
of constructing worthy manhood and womanhood
out of the inherent natures of their children?</p>

<p>1. <i>Good health.</i>&mdash;It is a difficult task to develop
a sound, efficient life without the fundamental
quality of good health. So it may be well to remind
parents of this fact and to urge them especially to
avoid in the lives of the children, first, the beginnings
of those lighter ailments which frequently grow into
menacing habits&mdash;for example, the diseases that
become chronic as a result of unnecessary exposure
to the weather&mdash;and second, those various contagious
diseases which so often permanently deplete
the health of children, such as scarlet fever and
whooping cough. It is now held by medical
authority that every reasonable effort should be
made to prevent children from taking such infectious
ailments&mdash;that the so-called diseases of children can
and should be practically all avoided.</p>

<p>2. <i>Usefulness.</i>&mdash;The newer ideals of character-building
call for the early training of all children as
if they were to enter permanently upon some bread-winning
pursuit. Such training is a most direct
means of culture and refinement, provided it be correlated
with the proper amount of book learning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
play and recreation. Such uniform and character-building
discipline tends to preserve the solidarity of
the race, and to acquaint all the young with the
thoughts and feeling of the great productive classes.
It may be this is now regarded as both a direct
means of culture and of leading the young mind
into an intimate acquaintance with the lives of the
masses. Such training is regarded also as one of
the best means of preserving our social democracy.
Therefore, although on account of inherited wealth
the child may apparently be destined for a life of
comparative ease, even then there is every justification
for teaching him early how to work as if he
must do so to earn his own living. Much more will
be said about this point later.</p>

<p>3. <i>Moral strength.</i>&mdash;In the construction of a good
life, moral strength must be estimated as one of the
important foundation stones. But this quality is not
so much a gift of nature or an inheritance as it is an
acquisition. It cannot be bought or acquired through
merely hearing about it, but it must come as a result
of a large number of experiences of trial and error.
The child acquires moral self-reliance from the practice
of overcoming temptation in proportion to his
strength, the test being made heavier as fast as his
ability to withstand temptation increases. As will
be shown later, it proves weakening to the character
of the growing child to keep him entirely free
from temptation and the possible contamination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
his character in order that he may grow up
&#8220;good.&#8221;</p>

<p>4. <i>Social efficiency.</i>&mdash;The good life is not merely
self-sustaining in an economic way, but it is also
trained in the performance of altruistic deeds. In
building up the lives of the young it will be necessary
and most helpful to think of the matter of
social efficiency. Therefore, it will be seen to that the
child have practice in assuming the leadership among
his fellows, in taking the initiative on many little
occasions, and in some instances to the extent of
standing out against the combined sentiment of his
young associates. Of course, during all this time he
will be backed strongly by the advice and the insistent
direction of his parents, the idea being to induce him
to think out his own social problems and to carry
forward any suitable plans of a social nature that he
may devise.</p>

<p>5. <i>Religious interest.</i>&mdash;Few parents will deny
that religious instruction is just as essential to the
development of a good society as is intellectual
instruction. Indeed, there is much evidence to bear
out the conviction that religion is a deep and permanent
instinct in all normal human beings. This
being the case, it is fair to say that such an instinct
should have some form of awakening and indulgence
in the life of the child. However, there is no thought
or intention of prescribing any particular form of
religious faith. He might at least be sent to Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
school and to church regularly where he may be
led to do a small amount of religious thinking on
his own account.</p>

<p>6. <i>Happiness.</i>&mdash;The good life is a happy life.
But nearly all the students of human problems seem
to think that happiness eludes the grasp of the one
who seeks it in a direct way. &#8220;I want my children
to be happy and enjoy life,&#8221; is often the remark
of well-meaning parents. They then proceed as if
joy and happiness could be had for money. It is
true that during his early years of indifference to any
serious concern or personal responsibility, the child
may be made extremely happy by giving him practically
everything his childish appetites may call for
and allowing him to grow up in idleness. But there
comes a time when the normal individual begins to
question his own personal and intrinsic worth. The
instincts and desires of mature life come on and if
there be not available the means for the realization
of the better instinctive ambitions, then bitterness
and woe are likely to become one&#8217;s permanent portion.</p>

<p>However, it may be put down as a certainty that
happiness and contentment will naturally come in
full measure into the life that has been well built
during the years of childhood and youth. If the
good health has been conserved, a life of usefulness
and service prepared for, moral strength built into
the character, social efficiency looked after continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>ously,
and something of religious experience not
neglected&mdash;it will most certainly follow as the day
follows the night that the wholesome enjoyments
and the durable satisfactions of living will come to
such an individual.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;These Canadian lads are enjoying their first lessons in live-stock management. We call
their conduct play, but surely no one was ever more in earnest than they.</span>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Is the human stock comparatively sound?</span></h4>

<p>There are now among the students of the home
problems many who are seriously interested in the
matter of breeding a better human stock. Many
noteworthy conclusions have already been reached,
and ample proofs have been produced to show
that the human animal follows the same general
lines of evolution as do the lower animal orders. It
is shown in general, for example, that little or nothing
that man has learned or acquired during his life
is transmitted to his offspring. That is, even though
a man devote many years to the intensive study of
music or mathematics or the languages, such study
will not affect the ability of his child in the study of
the specialized subject. The same unaffected result
obtains in respect to any other form of expertness
of the merely acquired sort. For example, the fact
that a man through long practice becomes expert
in the use of the typewriter does not affect the character
of the child in respect to such ability. It is a
no less difficult task for the child to learn to master
the use of the typewriter keyboard.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is shown very conclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
that physical and mental characters inborn in the
life of a parent tend at all times to be transmitted
to the child, although many traits are known to be
wanting in the first generation of children and to
appear in the second or successive generations. According
to the law of Mendel, the traits of the parents
are transmitted to the child about as follows: one-half
of the elements of one&#8217;s physical and mental
natures are inherited from his parents, one-fourth
from his grandparents, one-eighth from his great-grandparents,
and so on. In any given case, however,
there might be great variation from this rule
of the averages, just as actual men and women vary
more or less widely from the average human height
of so many feet and inches.</p>

<p>There is no thought here of discussing the intricate
problems of eugenics. The purpose of this brief
dogmatic sketch is that of attempting to induce
parents to believe that the great mass of our American-born
children are comparatively sound in their
physical and mental inheritances. The pathologists
profess to be able to prove that nature is most
kind to the new-born child in respect to inheritance
of disease. In fact, it is shown that very few diseases
are directly transmitted through the blood,
and that many once so regarded are now found to
be infectious in their natures. There is considerable
indication, however, that the children of the diseased&mdash;tuberculous
parents, for example,&mdash;inherit a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
weakened power of resistance for such disease. But
this matter is somewhat foreign to our present discussion.</p>

<p>Best of all, for our present consideration, is the
great mass of evidence sustaining the theory that
about ninety-nine per cent of our new-born infants
are potentially good in an economic and moral sense.
That is to say, this great majority of the young
humanity have latent within their natures at the
beginning of life the possibilities of development
into sound, self-reliant manhood and womanhood.</p>

<p>So, the writer of these lines would gladly lead rural
parents to the point of being very courageous and
optimistic about their infant children. He would
have them see in the latter all the possibilities of
good and efficiency that they may care to attempt
to bring out by thoughtful and conscientious training.
For that matter, it can be shown that many of
the leaders of men are constantly springing up out
of the ranks of the common masses and from
those of humble parentage. Some of these great
leaders, it is true, are what may be called accidental
geniuses in respect to their native strength and their
persistent life purposes. But many others, and
perhaps the majority of them, are merely men and
women who have been reasonably sound at birth
and who have been trained from childhood to maturity
in a manner that best served to build up strong,
efficient character.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
<i>THE TIME TO BUILD</i></h3>


<p>We shall continue to assume that the reader, if a
parent, is thinking of his child as being in the position
of one whose character requires constant attention
in order that it may be built up through the
right sort of training and the right sort of practices.
Just as certainly as there is a best time in the season
to plow corn and also a time not to plow, as there is
a time to plow deep and another time to plow shallow,
so there is unquestionably a best time to give
the child any particular form of training or to withhold
it. In general, it may be said that the most
effective training in respect to the human young is
that which centers most closely around the childish
interests and instincts.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What of the human instincts</span></h4>

<p>By observing critically for a few days the conduct
of an infant child, one may notice two or three pronounced
instincts at work producing helpful results
in the little life.</p>

<p>1. There is the instinct to nurse, which is so fundamental
in securing the food with which to sustain
and build up the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>2. There is the accessory instinct of crying, also
often necessary as nature&#8217;s signal for another intake
of the food supply. Associated with these two instincts
are a number of reflexes which take care of
the important organic processes, such as digestion,
assimilation, and excretion. Now, we have practically
all there is to the &#8220;character&#8221; of the human
infant. He has, as yet, no instinct for fighting, for
sexual love, or for business. And any effort to arouse
and make use of the last-named dormant qualities
would be futile as well as ridiculous. In respect to a
vast majority of the things to be learned, the child
is a mere bundle of potentialities, all of which must
bide their time for an awakening. In short, wise
parents soon learn that the center of life in the infant
child is in the stomach, and that if he be fed rightly,
kept much in the open air, clothed comfortably, and
bathed frequently, the body-building processes will
usually go on in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>3. Although the little life seems so tiny and the
daily round of infantile activities so simple and monotonous,
the character-developing processes are already
making their subtle beginnings. For example,
the first lessons in habit are being inculcated through
the comparative rhythm in the infant&#8217;s life. It will
be found both conducive to good health and helpful
to character-development to attend to all the infant&#8217;s
needs with strict regularity. Let us follow the new-born
child around his little cycle and see what hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>pens.
First, he is given a hearty meal, which is
followed at once by perhaps two hours of profound
sleep. Then, there is a gradual waking, the body
writhes and wiggles slightly, and then more, and then
still more, until a loud cry is set up. Under healthy
conditions the crying should go on for a very few
minutes, as it helps to send the good blood through
every part of the body, purifying and building up
the parts and carrying out the effete matter. The
function of excretion is not only thus much aided,
but the nervous equilibrium is completely restored.
The little life has now swung completely round to
the beginning point of two hours previously and it is
ready to start on another journey with the intake
of another hearty meal.</p>

<p>It will be found that the life circle described above
continues with slight variations for the first few weeks,
the child sleeping probably twenty to twenty-two
hours out of twenty-four, if it be in a natural state
of health. But slowly the conduct of the infant will
become more complex, and that in response to the
growths and changes taking place within his body.
It will be found that he can take a heartier meal,
can stay awake longer, kick harder, wriggle more, and
cry louder as the days multiply. In a month or so
his eyes will be seen following some brilliant or attractive
moving body, while the impulsive movements
of the hands will begin to suggest some slight definition
of their conduct. Not long thereafter, the baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
smile will break out in a reflex fashion and the hands
will likewise grasp objects placed in the little palms.
Co&#246;rdinate with these new activities, nature is at
work storing up new nerve structures and cells, especially
in the region of the spinal cord and the cranial
centers.</p>

<p>4. The child is all the while learning. As yet,
there is little for the caretaker to do other than to
feed the infant with exceeding care and regularity,
and to enjoy the awakening of the new infant activities.
In four to six months, the young learner
will lead a much more complex life,&mdash;sitting alone,
holding things in his hands, and looking about the
room. But it must be understood that he still hears
and sees very few things in a definite way. Then,
in the next two or three months he will first creep,&mdash;he
should in time be induced to do so if possible for
the sake of his health,&mdash;at length he will stand upright,
and finally walk. None of these processes
must be hastened, although they may be aided when
the inner prompting and strength warrant such
conduct.</p>

<p>5. During the second year there will probably
break out with sudden and surprising strength the
new instinct of anger. It has been latent there all
the time, but the low degree of intelligence and of
nerve structure has not given it proper support and
indulgence. But on an occasion there is perhaps
taken from the child some cherished plaything, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
he suddenly flies into a rage, yelling, screaming,
kicking, and growing red in the face. This outburst
of rage is a most interesting and enjoyable aspect
to the parent who rightly understands children,
although some ignorantly make it a matter of deep
concern, regarding it as significant of a vicious character
in the coming boy and man.</p>

<p>The purpose of this present discussion is to illustrate
how the human instincts come into their functions
at various times during the life of the growing
child. And the further purpose is to urge that such
thing be <i>watched for and met with just the sort of training
necessary for permanent and helpful results</i>.</p>

<p>Now, let the little child fly into a rage two or three
times and have his anger appeased through indulgence
in the thing he cries for, and he has acquired
his first lesson in the management of the parent or
nurse. He has learned that if he wants a thing, all
he needs to do is to squall or yell and the desired
results will be forthcoming. But this childish rage
really furnishes the occasion for the beginning of some
disciplinary lessons. &#8220;Should I give the child everything
he cries for, or withhold the desired object
until he quits?&#8221; asks an anxious parent. Neither
rule is necessarily the right one, and yet both, on
occasions, may be correct. Suppose, instead of the
infant you have a five-year-old boy who cries for a
loaded revolver he happens to see in your hand.
Would you give it to him to stop his crying, or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>hold
it? Suppose again he should cry for the return
of his own plaything which some one unjustly snatched
from him. Would you return his plaything to stop
his crying, or let him cry it out? Now, here is implied
the correct answer in dealing with the outburst
of anger in the infant. It is all a matter of justice
and fairness. If some agency, human or otherwise,
snatches his food from his mouth, and the child
squalls for its return, indulge the infant at once.
If he has been well fed, comfortably clad and bathed,
and under every proper consideration should lie
still and behave himself, then do not run and take
him up because he happens to be trying your patience
with his squalling. Hold him to it and let him bawl
it out. There is really nothing better coming to him
if you are thinking of the development of his character&mdash;and
your own.</p>

<p>6. So, somewhat later on you will find this same
instinct of anger showing itself in the various forms
of fighting and quarreling. The parent who understands
the true natures of healthy children will not
worry for a moment because the children show natural
dispositions for contention and combativeness. On
the other hand, it will be understood that these very
tendencies furnish the occasion of many a lesson in
social ethics. How can the child ever learn to be
just and fair to his mates or square and considerate
in his dealings with adults unless it be through the
give-and-take experiences that come from attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>ing
to get more than his share,&mdash;and failing much
of the time,&mdash;and from attempting to over-ride the
rights and privileges of others, and having such attempts
properly thwarted? Indeed, it may be regarded
as a great misfortune to the child if he has to
grow up as the only one in a home and is denied the
daily companionship of those of his own age from
whom he may learn justice and fairness as a result
of his attempts to get more than is just and fair for
himself.</p>

<p>7. The watchful parents will observe that perhaps
some time during the second half year, and with
some pronounced repetitions later, there will be clear
manifestations of the instinct of fear on the part of
the child. Again, there is nothing for deep concern
other than to meet this instinct in a general way as
has been observed for the others named and to give
the proper training. Fear must have been a human
necessity during many years of savagery and barbarism.
It still has its positive and negative values
in the development of character. It serves as a deterrent
from dangerous and criminal acts. It is also
found to deter the growing infant from doing many
a thing which he ought to be learning to do. Fear
shows its most interesting aspects in the form of what
has been called social sensitiveness; that is, bashfulness,
shyness, reticence, and the like.</p>

<p>Parents should by all means watch closely the
various childish and youthful tendencies to fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
allowing those fears which promise to be helpful to
remain in the life or to die out slowly through counteracting
conduct; and eliminating those other forms
which would seem to serve no useful purpose. Examples
of the latter sort would be the fear of ferocious
animals and of murderers. Such mortal enemies are
so uncommon in this civilized land that fear of them
will probably be of no service to life. On the other
hand, it may stunt and deter the development of
courage. Especially do such fears tend to induce
the habit of unnecessary concern and deep worry,
thus destroying the peace and happiness and cutting
off the length of years of many members of our society.</p>

<p>8. There is no questioning the value of social
sensitiveness in respect to the development of character
in the young. Some degree of bashfulness and
embarrassment in dealing with people, especially
those regarded by him as of superior worth, may be
considered an actual asset in the life of the growing
boy. This bashfulness will give him a rich inner
experience of doubts and fears, and of hopes and
triumphs. Slowly, under proper guidance and direction,
the sensitiveness wears away through repeated
experience of a contrary sort, and such qualities as
create a self-reliance take its place.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is doubtless a misfortune,
especially for the boy, to become blas&#233;&mdash;indifferent
and unembarrassed in the presence of people of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
ranks and conditions&mdash;while he is yet a mere lad.
Under our present organization of society, the boy
who would win the life race must have much experience
of trial and error, of failure and success, and of
tribulation and triumph; and all that for the sake of
a self-reliant character. Now, the boy who has lost
all sense of embarrassment in the presence of others
is likely to be denied the stirring inner experiences
just named, and to settle down in an indifferent, self-satisfied
attitude toward the big problems of human
conduct. It may be counted, therefore, as an indication
of much promise and advantage that the
country youth and the country maiden continue to
be comparatively &#8220;green&#8221; and bashful during the
period of their adolescence.</p>

<p>9. The instinct of sexual love will manifest itself
at the proper time and age. Before so doing, certain
organic changes and inner nerve developments
must take place. Parents may learn some lessons
from observation of this instinct that will apply to
practically all the others. For example, there should
be no attempt to hurry the manifestation and the
functioning of the instinct, nor should the training
necessary for its development and refinement be
denied or withheld. Of all the many inner awakenings
that come to the developing human being, there
is probably none that quite matches the surging
energy of sexual love in healthy young manhood
and womanhood. And to an extraordinary degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
opportunities for instruction and development of
the character become present at this time.</p>

<p>First of all, parents need to be reminded of the
naturalness and wholesomeness of the sex instincts
in adolescent boys and girls. They must be urged
to provide carefully for its natural growth through
the proper commingling of the sexes in a social way,
and yet there must be preserved in the young lives
just enough strangeness and mystery about the sex
matters as to indulge the poetic and the romantic
aspects of the unfolding natures. It need not,
therefore, be a matter of worry and unusual concern
to parents if their fifteen-year-old son and a neighbor&#8217;s
thirteen-year-old daughter show pronounced
tendencies to be &#8220;crazy in love&#8221; with each other.
However, this situation furnishes most fitting opportunities
for teaching the boy courtly manners, gallantry,
consideration for women of all ages; and
that through and by means of his own personal experience.
In fact, this stirring period of sex-love
opens up in the mind of the boy reflections that tend
to run out into every possible avenue of his future life.</p>

<p>Likewise, the girl. That same little girl who
shortly ago hated boys and declared she would never
have anything to do with them is now manifesting
much interest in the youth of her acquaintance. This
thing cannot be laughed to scorn, or scolded away,
or whipped out of the life of either boy or girl. Its
roots are in the sex organs as well as in the heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
This first love period furnishes the rarest opportunities
for teaching the girl proper lessons in respect to
her comeliness, her purity of thought, and the sweetness
of her own personal character. If during this
time she be withheld entirely from wholesome association
with boys and young men, there is a probability
that she may become a drone or a mope, and
especially that she may lose valuable training in the
acquisition of those winsome ways so helpful to young
women in the matter of their obtaining suitable life
companions.</p>

<p>Perhaps less need be said in respect to giving the
growing son those forms of social training which
make it possible for him to win to his side an attractive
helpmate. But beyond the question of a doubt
there can and should be much done by way of training
the daughter in this respect. In addition to her
good health, her moral self-reliance, and those other
desirable qualities illustrated in a preceding paragraph,
the young woman who is thoroughly prepared
for meeting successfully the issues of life has had careful
training in all the practices that refine and beautify
her character.</p>

<p>This duty of rural parents to the growing daughter
is no less imperative than in the case of city parents.
It may be considered as an excellent way of planning
for the future happiness and well-being, not merely
for one, but doubtless for an entire family, if the
growing girl be indulged and directed reasonably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
social matters during this period of greatest strength
of her natural sex instinct. This thing cannot be
safely put off a few years with the thought that the
family will move to town and then the girl may have
her proper opportunities of training. After such
procrastination and neglect, it becomes too late ever
to correct the many faults of omission.</p>

<p>10. There develops somewhat late in the lives of
young men and young women what might be called
the &#8220;homing&#8221; instinct, which amounts to nothing
other than a deep and pronounced prompting from
within to set definitely about the matter of getting
into a home of one&#8217;s own and providing for and
building it up. This is different from the mere sex
instinct named above, although perhaps an outgrowth
of it. It must be noted in passing that this
homing instinct, when at its strongest, furnishes the
proper occasion for instruction in respect to the home
and the home-building affairs. Happy indeed is the
young man or the young woman who, after a period
of such instruction, may have the opportunity of settling
down in a suitable dwelling place and there beginning
the establishment of the ideal family life.</p>

<p>11. Unquestionably there dawns in the life of
normal young men&mdash;and perhaps to a milder degree
in respect to young women&mdash;a pronounced instinct
of a business and economic sort. This inner prompting
is doubtless associated with the two last named.
It may be observed by any person who knows how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
to study the lives of children and young people that
some particular youth who a few months ago was
a spendthrift, indifferent of his future needs and welfare,
is now heard to declare emphatically again and
again that he must get into business, must save and
invest his means and provide for his future needs.
So, there is not a little evidence in effect that we have
here another inner development of the nerve mechanism.
And the time is most fit and opportune for
the parents to exhaust every reasonable effort to discover
what the youth is best suited for as a life practice
and to guide him on toward the realization of
that purpose. Much more will be said in another
chapter in respect to the choice of a vocation.</p>

<i>THE RURAL HOME AND CHARACTER
DEVELOPMENT</i></h3>


<p>That the farm home is an ideal place in which to
build up the lives of growing boys and girls has become
almost a trite saying. But that rural parents
are yet failing to realize the child-nurturing possibilities
of such a place may be exemplified in thousands
of instances. When we point to the farm
home as being the best possible place for rearing children,
we mean that it contains all the crude materials
for such work, and that there must be in charge of
that work some one who is conscious of the many
aspects of the problem. So we hope to show the
fathers and mothers of the farm community, not
what they might do if they were differently situated,
but as specifically as possible what there is in the
present rural home situation that can be made
directly available in the construction of the lives
of their children.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What agencies build up character?</span></h4>

<p>First of all, we must ask, What are the ordinary
forces which need to be brought into service in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
development of children? At the head of the list,
we should name play, as furnishing a great variety
of instructive activities; then, work and industry;
after that, the recreation that comes properly after
the performance of work. So, we have with all
their implied meanings the three great child-developing
agencies: play, work, recreation. Now the
question naturally presents itself, Can the ordinary
farm life be made to furnish in right amount and
proportion these three essential elements of character
development?</p>

<p>1. <i>Play.</i>&mdash;The necessity of indulging and training
properly the play instinct of the child is becoming
so fully appreciated of late that many of the state
legislatures, and even the national Congress, have
seen fit to make it a matter of deep concern. In
order that all children may have full exercise of the
divine, inherent right to play and to learn through
play, many so-called child labor laws have been passed.
These enactments have prescribed conditions under
which children will be permitted to work at gainful
occupations, and in the majority of cases they have
strictly forbidden such child labor below the ages
of fourteen to sixteen.</p>

<p>But the foregoing efforts in behalf of the young
have been of a somewhat negative sort, merely guaranteeing
the child the right to play. On the positive
side, much is also being done. The scientific students
of child life have been pointing to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
benefits of play and to the present need for larger
means and fuller opportunities for play on the part
of the masses of children. As an outcome of all this
research and public agitation, there is now in progress
a general movement which looks to the placing at
the disposal of children everywhere the equipment
and apparatus necessary for building up the character
by means of play experience. The large cities
are expending millions of dollars on municipal playgrounds,
and the towns and rural communities are
catching the spirit also.</p>

<p>It has been shown beyond a question that adult
life can be prepared for and enriched in many ways
by means of scientifically provided play during childhood.
Two or three results are especially sought
through the playground training: (1) better physical
health and increased power to resist disease; (2) enlarged
opportunities for the outlet of the spontaneous
activities through the use of the hands and other
parts of the body; (3) the provision of a powerful
deterrent of evil thought and deed and of juvenile
crime; (4) the manifold opportunities for learning
how to get along with one&#8217;s fellows and to treat them
in fairness and justice.</p>

children grew up.</span>
</div>

<p>It has already been urged that sound health constitutes
one of the foundation stones of good character.
Play is especially conducive to sound health.
Some may think that work without much if any
play will bring about the same results in the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>life, but such proves not to be the case. The monotony
and drudgery of enforced labor have been
crushing the lives of children everywhere, especially
until the wise legislation of very recent years prevented
such thing. Strange to say, the same
amount of exertion in spontaneous play may build
up and strengthen the physical and mental life of
the child. What is the secret of the striking difference
in the result? Spontaneity! is the answer.
The child goes at his play with a joy and an eagerness
which are entirely absent from work&mdash;a sufficient
guarantee that his nature is being fed upon the very
stuff which his soul craves. It is true that children
will play in a bare room containing nothing more
than a pile of trash, but such a situation is woefully
lacking on the side of instruction. Very
little will be learned from a year of such ill-provided
play.</p>

<p>So, there is every necessary reason for urging that
the farm home provide not only the time and the
occasion for the play life of the children, but that
the means and proper materials also be looked after.
At a certain rural home in the state of Michigan,
where two boys and one girl were growing up, were
found the following nearly ideal arrangements for
the play life: a small clump of trees, which afforded
opportunities for climbing and ample shade during
the warm weather; a swing hung between two of
the trees; a pole serving as a horizontal bar between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
two others; and a ladder leading to a rude playhouse
constructed between the forks of a branching maple
tree. Thereabout were seen also a boy&#8217;s wagon, two
home-made sleds and other materials of this same
general class, not to mention a fairly well-kept lawn,
where the children could romp.</p>

<p>Now the cost of all the foregoing materials would
be trifling in a money sense and not very expensive
in point of preparation and work, while they would
pay for themselves a hundred-fold in their results
for character-development. If necessary, it could
even be shown how just such provision for the play
of the boys and girls on the farm will in time add to
the actual cash value of the place and to the money-earning
power of the boys and girls whose lives are
being served. It seems altogether fitting to remind
rural parents of their duty in respect to their children
even though the mortgage may not yet have been
lifted, and even though some of the live stock may
have to suffer a little, and some of the farm crops
deteriorate slightly. Let there be provided, first of
all, some adequate materials for the indulgence of
the play instinct of the child.</p>

<p>2. <i>Work.</i>&mdash;This term implies a wide meaning,
and deserves a lengthy discussion. In a chapter to
follow under the title &#8220;How Much Work for the
Country Boy,&#8221; we shall give due attention to it.
The purpose here is to advise the parent to make
a study of the situation and to make provision for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
amount and kind of work and industry necessary
for the proper culture of the growing child.</p>

<p>First of all, there must be appreciated the sharp
distinction between work and play. The latter is
spontaneous, allowing the child to follow his caprice
of mind. He may take up one play activity and drop
it at any moment that another appeals to him more
strongly. But with work, the situation is different.
The purpose is outside of and not within the performance,
as in the case of play. The work looks
toward some end necessary of achievement and carries
with it the elements of sacrifice, of giving out of one&#8217;s
life something that is his very own in order that some
other thing may be acquired. In the case of work
the normal child probably at first finds almost any
assigned task irksome. He feels that he is being more
or less unfairly or unnecessarily driven to it and that
when he grows to be a man, he will have a lot of money
and hire somebody else to do the work.</p>

<p>All natural, healthy-minded boys are at first somewhat
stubborn and rebellious in regard to work.
No matter how good their parents may be, if merely
turned loose in the world without direction and the
spur of authority, they will almost invariably avoid
manual labor. So it might as well be put down at
once as a rule that every boy who is to become a
real worker and an industrious character must be
set definitely at his tasks while a mere child and held
strictly to their performance. After much persistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
urging, the young worker begins to forget the thought
of being driven to his duty and to acquire instead
a habit of industry. By slow degrees he develops
within a sense of obligation in relation to work, also
a feeling of responsibility for tasks done or left undone.
Finally, after years of this sort of experience, the
young industrialist reaches a point in his life when
he can throw himself enthusiastically into some sort
of well chosen occupation. And then and there
emerges from his inner consciousness the exceeding
great joy known to so many of the industrious men
and women whose worthy life-long devotion to work
is constantly reconstructing this good world in which
we live.</p>

<p>It will be understood, of course, that the term
work as here used includes the school training. The
ordinary child regards the appointed duties of lesson
getting in the nature of work and feels the same pressure
of insistence and compulsion in relation to them.
Unquestionably, the ordinary school course goes part
way toward furnishing discipline in industry. The
course of the newer schools about to be instituted
throughout the country will reach still farther in
this direction. It is very encouraging indeed to
observe that the public school curriculum is destined
to include, not only the study of books and the recitation
of lessons learned from books, but also the many
forms of manual labor and industry applicable to
the character of the growing child. But until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
public school authorities have provided such an
ideal course of training, parents must see to it that
the class-room duties be thoroughly supplemented
with carefully assigned home tasks of the industrial
training sort. In a later chapter specific attention
will be given the question of the schooling of the
country boy and the country girl.</p>

<p>3. <i>Recreation.</i>&mdash;What a vast amount of misunderstanding
and misuse there is of this term!
Observe, if you will, the real meaning of the term or
of the kindred word, to re-create. It implies in this
use that the body has been depleted, worn out, or
fatigued by work and that there is to be a rebuilding
of the same. But it is amusing&mdash;or would be if it
were not so pathetic&mdash;to see how city parents often
bestir themselves in an effort to provide recreation for
their idle boys. Many of these boys who are seen
loafing about the home town during practically the
entire summer vacation period are given an outing
in order that they may thus be furnished &#8220;recreation&#8221;&mdash;from
indolence.</p>

<p>But farm parents are inclined to err on the other
side. That is, they tend to over-work their boys and
not to give them enough outings to furnish proper
recreation and renewed zeal for the work required
of them. Hence, the need of carefully considering
the matter of the outings for the farm boy and girl.
It can most probably be shown, for example, that
the boy who works on the farm five and a half days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the week and who is given the other half day for rest
and recreation&mdash;that he does more work in the five
and one-half days and does it better than he would
do in six full days without the half-holiday. The
question here is that of a balanced schedule. How
long should the boy be held to his task before being
allowed a holiday or recreation period?</p>

<p>Just how can these half-holidays, outings, and the
like, be worked into the farm boy&#8217;s program so as
to make them contributive to the up-building of his
character? What of this sort can be done to cause
him to return to his assigned tasks with greater zeal
and enthusiasm? How can it be provided that the
boy may look forward to these outings with a thrill
of joy during the long days he has to spend behind
the plow or in the harvest field? Finally, how can
these recreation periods, large and small, be so associated
with his work-a-day tasks that he may come
to regard farm life as a wholesome type of vocation&mdash;one
that he may follow with pleasure and profit for
himself, and one in which he may succeed so well as
to make his achievements constitute a living commendation
of such a calling to others? In a later
discussion there will be shown many methods whereby
the recreation experience of the farm boys and girls
may be properly looked after.</p>

<p>Few persons seem to appreciate the value of solitude
as a means of recreating and building up the
inner life. Probably one of the greatest agencies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the development of many a powerful personality is
the fact that its possessor was compelled by force of
circumstances while young to spend much time in
the company of his or her own thoughts. It is impossible
to think intelligently while one is doing any
body-straining work; for example, wood sawing or
hay pitching. But there are many forms of occupation
for boys and girls on the farm which permit of
comparative rest of the body. So the foundations
of many a worthy career have been laid in the silent
reflections of the boy spending the day alone in the
woods or on the prairies with his cattle and dog and
pony, or sitting on the seat of the riding plow.</p>

<p>Likewise, the farmer&#8217;s daughter, during the performance
of many simple, non-fatiguing tasks, reflects
perforce upon the larger meanings of life and
makes out in mind many plans for the time when
she hopes to undertake the mastery of various trying
and interesting problems. Lack of this enforced
solitude and its attendant reflections&mdash;lack of the
discovery of the joy of being at regular intervals alone
with the great soul of Nature and with one&#8217;s inner
consciousness&mdash;doubtless contributes in some measure
to the undoing of city boys and girls. The constant
turmoil of the street, the excitement of the
ever changing scenes and situations, give an over-indulgence
to the senses, ripen the judgments
too early, and rob the character of those soberer
habits which later enable one to find good in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
common situations and the common people of the
world.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, recommended that farm parents
provide for a part of the sterner duties of the boys
and girls such tasks as will allow for comparative
rest of the body while the mind may tarry undisturbed
with the reflections of the inner life.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Moving to town for the children</span></h4>

<p>The practice of the well-to-do farmer who moves
to town to &#8220;educate his children&#8221; is an old story and
is fraught with many a hidden tragedy, to say nothing
of the impoverishment of the land and of the
social order left behind. Why cannot the intelligent
farmer remain on the home place and join a
movement having for its purpose that of making
the neighborhood a more desirable place of human
habitation?</p>

<p>One of the dullest places in the world is the country
town which has been filled up with retired farmers.
These are usually men who came into the place
for the purpose of getting all the possible advantages
at the lowest possible cost. In the typical case the
new city dweller of this class secures a very good
residence, and that often, if possible, just outside the
city limits, in order to avoid local taxes. He takes
little or no interest in the town&#8217;s municipal affairs
and votes against nearly all proposed improvements.
He keeps his own cow, horse, chickens, and garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and brings extra supplies in from the farm. Gradually
he takes on a few of the city ways. That is,
he uses less home produce and does some buying at
the stores. But for want of stimulating employment
he gradually grows stouter and mentally more stupid,
sleeping away many of the hours of the day in his
chair&mdash;an indication that he is dying at the top and
that he is soon to be cut down. Really, the retired
farmer is a nuisance to the town and the town is a
bore to him.</p>

<p>But what of the children whom he brought in to
&#8220;educate&#8221;? They learn rapidly, soon taking on
the city manners. The natural restraints from evil
conduct, which the farm home furnished, are now
wanting. The blare and bluster of the town both
excite and delight them, while the parents have positively
no rules or standards by which to govern and
direct their young in the new situation. All the boys
and girls need to do in order to gain parental consent
for going out at night is to declare that &#8220;everybody
is going&#8221; or that they are &#8220;expected&#8221; to be there,
and the thing is settled. Thus the young ruralists
newly come to town go dancing and prancing off
into a veritable world of sweet dreams and delights&mdash;spoiled
forever for any service that they might
have rendered in building up the country community&mdash;and
finally destined to become mere cogs in the
ever grinding wheel of some city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A back-to-the-country club</span></h4>

<p>Nearly every town and city of the United States
has had a so-called Commercial Club. This has
been in reality a boosters&#8217; club bent first of all on
bringing big business to the place and thus opening
the way for a bigger population. Anything for the
sake of more people has been the watchword. Now,
I would reverse this order of things. Nearly every
one of these towns and cities needs a club or committee
that might have for its purposes: (1) to show the
would-be retired farmer how to shift the burdens from
his wife as housekeeper, how to provide better social
and intellectual advantages for his children and yet
<i>stay on the farm</i>; (2) to find means and methods
whereby to plant in the rural community those
persons of the city population who are not making a
fair living in their present positions, seeking first of
course to choose those who are capable of transplanting
and then preparing them with care for the
change.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that this thing can be successfully
thought out,&mdash;that is, how the worthy poor city
family may be removed to the country and there
through hard work gradually acquire enough land
whereon to earn a fair living at least. This end will
never be accomplished by merely driving out the
poor families, but rather by means of scientific and
sympathetic practice of re-establishing them. Well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>conducted
research shows that these poor people are
nearly all constituted of good, sound, human stock.
So, if transported under the conditions named, there
may be expected to come forth in the second generation
a splendid crop of rural boys and girls.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<i>THE COUNTRY MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN</i></h3>


<p>Greater attention needs to be given to the conservation
of the farmer&#8217;s wife. Although there are
many other justifications for giving more thought
to the care and the comfort of the country mother,
the single fact of her very close relation to the children
growing up in the home, and of her peculiar responsibilities
as center of life there, warrant us in devoting
a chapter to her interests. Recently, while passing
upon a country highway, the author met a funeral
procession. A little inquiry revealed a pathetic
situation, one that has been repeated thousands of
times throughout the length and breadth of this fair
country. The deceased was the wife of a young
farmer, both of them under thirty-five years of age,
hard working and ambitious for success, but thoughtless
of their own health and comfort. Their farm
was somewhat new and unimproved, there were hundreds
of things to do other than the routine affairs
of home keeping and crop raising. Worst of all,
there was a mortgage to be lifted. After all reasonable
improvements were made and the mortgage
paid off, then, according to their plans, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
going to take matters easy. But the delicate cord of
life suddenly broke in the case of the wife, and left
the young husband as overseer of the farm and
home and sole caretaker of three little children.</p>

<p>How can parents hope to produce a better crop
of boys and girls in the farm communities so long
as the typical farm wife is crushed into the earth
with the over-weight of the burdens placed upon her?
A few minutes&#8217; enumeration in this same rural neighborhood
brought out the startling fact that in fully
half of the homes a scene similar to the one just
described had been enacted during the last score of
years. That is to say, during the twenty years, fully
one-half of the farm mothers living in that particular
neighborhood had died before their time from one
cause or another. In most instances the death
occurred during what we usually speak of as the prime
years of life, and at a time when the rose bloom should
naturally be fresh upon the cheek. Fortunately, this
serious condition, still present in some communities, is
being gradually improved by the improved methods.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Poor conditions of women</span></h4>

<p>The report of the Country Life Commission makes
the following suggestions:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The relief to farm women must come through a
general elevation of country living. The women
must have more help. In particular these matters
may be mentioned: Development of a co&#246;perative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
spirit in the home, simplification of the diet in many
cases, the building of convenient and sanitary houses,
providing running water in the house and also more
mechanical help, good and convenient gardens, a less
exclusive ideal of money getting on the part of the
farmer, providing better means of communication,
as telephones, roads, and reading circles, and developing
of women&#8217;s organizations. These and other
agencies should relieve the woman of many of her
manual burdens on the one hand and interest her
in outside activities on the other. The farm woman
should have sufficient free time and strength so that
she may serve the community by participating in its
vital affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate IV.</span></p>

to lengthen the lives of tired country mothers.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>In discussing this same matter, Henry Wallace,
a member of the Commission, says in his paper,
<i>Wallaces&#8217; Farmer</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been saying that the mother is the
hardest worked member of the family, which is often
and we believe generally true. They have been saying
that in the anxiety of the farmer to get more land,
he not only works himself too hard, but his wife too
hard, and the boys and girls so hard that the boys
get disgusted and leave the farm, and the girls marry
town fellows and go to town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the farmer&#8217;s wife is really the most important
and essential person on the farm. As such she
needs the most care and consideration. You are
careful, very careful, not to over-work your horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
How much more careful you should be not to over-work
the mother of your children. You rein back
the free member of the team. You take special
care of the brood mare, and the cow that gives three
hundred pounds of butter. Have you always kept
the freest of all workers, your wife, from doing too
much? How about this?&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">For the sake of the children</span></h4>

<p>But this chapter, as well as the entire book, is being
prepared in the interest of boys and girls. So we
shall attempt to show a number of specific conditions
that may be sought as tending to conserve the
strength and the life of the rural mother, with a view
to her continuing to be in every best sense of the
word a caretaker and conserver of the lives of her
own children.</p>

<p>1. <i>Surplus nerve energy.</i>&mdash;However it may be
achieved, the thing to work for in this connection
is a surplusage of nerve energy. If the child training
is to go on in a satisfactory manner, the mother
especially, and if possible both parents, must have
stated times and occasions for looking after such
training and for inculcating a series of important
fundamental lessons. The first and best test of this
child-rearing situation may be made at evening. If,
after the work of the ordinary day, the mother is
still fresh enough to take a real interest in the children&#8217;s
affairs, to read to them briefly and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
tell them a story or two, or to read for further preparations
of her work with them,&mdash;then it may be
said that her life energies are being conserved in a
fairly satisfactory manner. The children will most
certainly reap the benefits. But if the close of the
ordinary day&#8217;s work finds the farm mother suffering
from physical and nervous exhaustion, cross and
impatient with the other members of the family, depressed
in spirit and gloomy as to the future, these
are signs which should give alarm to the head of the
household and arouse him to the point of looking
into such distressful conditions, and setting them
right.</p>

<p>2. <i>A rest period.</i>&mdash;How would it do to plan for
the mother a daily period of rest and relaxation?
Would not such a program furnish something of a
guarantee of length of life in her own case and of
peace and contentment in the home, and of improved
well-being in respect to the children? How shall
we state this question? Must the very lives of the
rural mother and her children be run through the
mill of over-work as a grist for the improvement and
up-building of the farm animals and the farm crops?
Or should all of these material things be valued only
in proportion as they contribute to the happiness and
contentment and the long life of the members of the
family? Too many farmers seem to say, as expressed
by their conduct: &#8220;I <i>must</i> lift that mortgage this
year! I <i>must</i> market so many bushels of corn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
so many head of live stock! So here goes my wife,
and here go my children into the hopper! Perhaps
they will have to give up their lives. At any cost
I <i>must</i> make this thing pay!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, how would it be to set apart an hour or
more each day, regularly, for the rest and relaxation
of the mother, and call it &#8220;Mother&#8217;s hour&#8221;? During
that time let it be the policy of the entire family
to require no work, no assistance, no favors of her,
unless it be in case of illness. During such a time
of recuperation, the delicate organism of the ordinary
woman would tend to regain its poise. The nerve
energy would be more or less restored, while she would
tend to view the better things of life more nearly
from their right angle. Best of all, she would regather
during the hour not a little strength to be
used later in the caretaking of her children. Try
it for a week.</p>

<p>3. <i>The home conveniences.</i>&mdash;This is not the place
for a detailed discussion of what might or ought to be
put into the house for the sake of the convenience of
the home-maker. But if such materials be thoughtfully
arranged, they may be made most effective,
even though they be small and inexpensive. A little
inquiry among the ordinary homes will show what
is meant here, by either the presence or the lack of
the things indicated. It is not so much a question
of expense as it is one of thoughtful provision. The
guiding principle of the home convenience is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
saving and conserving the strength of the housekeeper.</p>

<p>There is especially one day in the week which
might be appropriately called the &#8220;mother-killing
day.&#8221; That is the occasion of her doing the washing
and ironing for the family. Not infrequently two
or three days thereafter are required for the restoration
of her normal strength and health. Now, it is
clearly the specific duty of the farmer to take hold
of just such matters as this and attempt seriously
to put them right. Doing the washing for four or
five, and that with the use of the wash tub, is a man&#8217;s
work so far as required muscular energy is concerned,
and very few women are able to do it regularly and
live out their allotted lives. Therefore, let the conscientious
farmer see to it first of all that some kind
of machinery be installed for lightening such wife-killing
tasks as that just named. Let him provide
such household helps and conveniences <i>first</i>, and
for the sake of the house mother and her children.
And then, if there be other means available, let him
provide the man-saving machinery about the barn
and the fields. In the chapter on &#8220;Constructing
a Country Dwelling,&#8221; fuller attention will be given
to these matters.</p>

<p>4. <i>The mother&#8217;s outings.</i>&mdash;The farmer who is
seriously interested in providing for the care and comfort
of his family, and for the instruction and intelligent
direction of his children, will see to it that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
life companion be allowed her share of outings.
This matter must be just as much on his mind as
that of marketing the produce. The usual habit of
the farmer&#8217;s wife is to give up willingly her rights and
opportunities of this sort. But she cannot well continue
to be spiritually strong and mentally well disposed
toward the world unless she be permitted to
get out among her friends and acquaintances at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>So, arrange carefully a series of outings for the
country mother. The beginning of such a program
is to provide that there be available for her use and
at her command a horse and carriage. This equipment
need not be of the finest quality, and it may
be used for other purposes, but when her needs appear,
it should be given up to her purposes. At least
one afternoon a week she should go away from the
place and be free as much as possible temporarily
from the cares of the household while she finds congenial
company among some of the neighboring
women, or at the library or elsewhere.</p>

<p>5. <i>The home help.</i>&mdash;The unending problem of
the home life throughout much of the civilized world
is that of obtaining adequate assistance in the performance
of the household work. Much of the time
such assistance from outside sources is practically
unavailable. And yet something must be done to
meet the situation. If there be young girls growing
up in the home, the solution of the problem may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and should, be met by means of requiring the daughters
to assist with the home duties. But in case there
be no daughters it is seriously recommended that
either the father or the boys do certain parts of the
heavier housework.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily beneath the dignity of the best
and most brilliant man of this country for him to
get down on his knees in his own home and help perform
the menial work there which threatens to break
the health of his life companion. If there be growing
sons in the family, there is every justification for training
them to assist in the housework in a case where
such assistance is needed to shield the health and
strength of the mother. It prepares for better manhood
and for more sympathetic protection of his own
wife to be, if the boy be required to do such things
and thus to become intimately acquainted with what
it means to perform the many burdensome tasks that
tend to wear away the lives of so many good women.</p>

<p>6. <i>The children shield the mother.</i>&mdash;There will
perhaps be no better occasion than this to remind
parents of the necessity of carefully training the growing
children to perform such deeds as will shield the
mother in the home, and show a sympathetic interest
in her welfare. These matters will not naturally
be acquired by children. The country to-day is
full of grown men whose mothers and wives have
worked themselves to death; and yet these men did
not detect the seriousness of the situation until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
was too late. There are many men of this same
general class who are willing and even anxious to
protect the women of the home from the crush of
over-work, but who know not how to do it. Such
faults as we have just named might easily have been
avoided had these men, during very early boyhood,
been brought into an intimate acquaintance with the
burdensome tasks of the household. Especially
should they have been drilled time after time in the
performance of deeds of love and sympathy in respect
to their mother. It may seem a little thing for a
younger child to rush to the table, call for and partake
of the best the table provides and, inattentive
to the wants of any other members of the family,
hurry off to his play full fed and happy. And yet
this very thing may be indicative of a serious lack
of attention to the rights and requirements of others,
such as may be carried over into his future home life
and there amount to serious abuse. Again, it must
be insisted that deeds of sympathy and altruism are
acquired through the actual and continued practice
of the performance of such deeds.</p>

<p>7. <i>Planning for the children.</i>&mdash;Among the other
splendid results of the conservation of the nerve
energy and the vital interests of the house mother
may be mentioned that of her ability to plan thoughtfully
for the instruction of the boys and girls. It is
not an easy task to select appropriate stories and
readings for the young. It is neither an easy nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
a trifling matter for the parent to be able to read
suitable stories to them and to interpret helpfully
such stories. It is not a trifling matter for the parents
to converse together an hour at evening and there
plan as to the future home instruction of their young.
When should this be introduced into the boy&#8217;s life
and when that into the girl&#8217;s life? What is a fair
allowance for the boy for what he does and for his
spending money for the Fourth of July, Christmas,
and the like? What is a fair allowance for the girl with
which to purchase her clothes and for her pin money?
When should each of them be told this and that
about the secrets of life, and where may helpful literature
thereon be obtained? Just when and how
much should the boy and girl be allowed to go among
the young people of the community? When we
consider the far-reaching results which their solution
may mean for the developing young lives, these and
many other such questions become exceedingly important.</p>

<p>8. <i>A common conspiracy.</i>&mdash;In many a farm home
to-day there is a secret compact which goes far to
shape the destiny of a great number of lives. Go
if you will to the farm home where the life of the
mother is being gradually crushed out by the over-work
and the lack of sympathetic protection on the
part of the husband, and you will almost invariably
find a secret understanding between the mother and
the growing children in reference to the future careers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the latter. It is implied by these words put into
the mouth of the mother: &#8220;Your father is too ambitious
about the work and in his desire for accumulating
wealth about the farm. He is over-working
me, is thoughtless of me, and indifferent to your
present needs and your future welfare. Work on
as you must, driven by him, but do as little as you
can and grow up to manhood and womanhood. Study
your books, get through with your schooling, and
in time find something easier for your own life
work. Perhaps we can persuade him to give it up
after a while and move to town, where you can go out
more, dress better, and get more enjoyment out of
life.&#8221; Thus, the children grow up to mistrust and
dislike their father, and to despise the vocation in
which he is engaged. Such a state of affairs will
precipitate their flight from the home nest. This
will take place at the earliest possible moment and
will often be in the nature of a leap into the dark,
anything to get away from the drudgery of the farm.</p>

<p>Mark you this situation well, you farm fathers,
and attack it in all possible haste with the best available
relief. A happy, contented, well-protected
farm mother almost certainly means the same sort
of farm children, while the converse situations will
also run in the same unvarying parallel. Do not
satiate your desire for more hogs and more land with
the sacrifice of the peace and happiness and the very
life-blood of your wife and children!</p>

<br />
<i>CONSTRUCTING THE COUNTRY DWELLING</i></h3>


<p>Much has been written in books, and more has
been spoken from platform and pulpit, relative to
the patriotism of the American people. In addition
to all this the public schools of city and country have
been consciously instructing the children with a
view to laying a permanent foundation in their lives
for love of the native land and for defense of the
national ideals. But it seems to me that the best
word on the subject of patriotic instruction has never
as yet been given wide publicity. So long as a boy
has to grow up in a home where there are meanness
and turmoil and strife and hatred and degradation,
one may point a thousand times with pride to our
great nation, display again and again before his
eyes the proud banner of freedom, sing with him
numberless times the patriotic songs eulogistic of
the fatherland and its national heroes,&mdash;under such
circumstances a boy can never be expected to develop
into anything other than a superficial patriot.
But give him a good home, simple and unadorned
though it may be, where love reigns, where his childish
needs are thoughtfully ministered unto, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>into
he may go at nightfall after a hard day&#8217;s work
and find rest and peace and comfort; a home whereinto
he may take his childish cares and perplexities
and place them before the affectionate consideration
of his parents and perhaps his elder brothers and
sisters; a place where he is carefully taught the rudiments
of filial respect and a wholesome regard for
work and industry,&mdash;bring up the boy in the midst
of these plain, sympathetic situations, and you have
a real patriot. Although he may be reminded only
occasionally of the meaning of the national flag, and
although he may read with no unusual interest about
the blood that was spilled on the national field of
battle, a life so reared would mean that the love of
home has become rooted in the heart of the young
patriot, and that he would rise up if need be and give
his life in defense of that home. In such a case, only
a small stretch of the imagination would make it
possible for the youth to regard the nation as his home
in the larger sense, while his willingness to defend
that home in time of real need would be none the
less present and strong.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Plans and specifications not available</span></h4>

<p>There are hundreds of types and thousands of
varieties of rural dwelling houses. It would perhaps
be impracticable to attempt to furnish definite plans
and specifications in connection with this chapter.
The wide variation in the nature of the selected sites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in the means available for building the home, in the
size of the family to be accommodated, and the
like, would hinder us in the attempt. But there are
certain principles that may perhaps apply in nearly
every instance and that especially in thought of
serving the first and best needs of the juvenile members
of the household.</p>

<p>It is altogether possible to make a two-room cottage
out on the open prairie a place suggestive of
repose, of beauty, and of other high ideals. So, no
matter how small and inexpensive the rural dwelling
may be, let the builders work first of all for that
simple beauty and attractiveness which may most
certainly invest the heart of the indweller with a
feeling of comfort and satisfaction. Let it be a
place, though humble, that may soon become to the
members of the family the most beloved spot on
earth. For, after all, the best things of life cannot
possibly be bought with money. There are often
misery and dissension and bitterness in the finest
palatial dwelling, while the essential elements of
beauty and worth may have lodgment in the hearts
of the humblest cottage dwellers. However, it is
not the intention here to argue any one into the
thought of building a humble cot for the mere sake
of humility. The point we desire to make is merely
this: that, although possessed of very meager
means with which to build, one can actually construct
a home in which the inhabitants thereof may dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in peace and contentment, and a place over which the
Spirit of the Most High may brood in great strength
and beauty.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Bring back those childhood scenes.&#8221;</span>
</span>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">What appeals to the children</span></h4>

<p>In the selection of a location and a site for the
dwelling the welfare of the children must be thought
of, second only to that of the house mother. Now,
what material arrangements will appeal to the growing
children and add much interest and romance
to their lives as in future time they view them in
retrospect? First of all, perhaps, a broken landscape
might well be mentioned, a hill or two near by the
place, with a sharp cliff or embankment to the crest
of which the children may climb and there cast
down missiles. Such things tend to add a charm to
the young lives. And then, if possible, have a
brook or larger stream of fresh running water. A
large river is less desirable on account of the danger
to child life. But a stream which may furnish, not
merely water for the live-stock, but a swimming and
bathing place for the children in summer and a
skating pond for them in winter, to say nothing
about the pleasures of fishing and boating&mdash;these
will appeal most strongly to the boys and girls.
And then, the woodland, or at least the shady grove
with trees to climb, and possibly nuts and wild flowers
to gather&mdash;a place where chipmunks and song birds
and the like may have their natural habitat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
wherefrom there may proceed the weird and doleful
sound of the night owl and the whip-poor-will; herein
one may find many of the crude materials well suited
to give proper nourishment to the souls of the young.</p>

<p>But the things just named will not nearly always be
accessible. Throughout many of the commonwealths
there are vast stretches of level plateaus with
scarcely a hill or woodland in sight, and yet covered
with a rich, tillable soil. These places may for good
reasons be selected for the site of a dwelling. But
they demand more work and heavier expense of
money and time before the best material surroundings
of an ideal home for boys and girls may be realized.
Before the house is scarcely laid out in such a place,
the shade and ornamental trees should be planted,
selecting for part of the planting a quick-growing
species that may be removed later after more permanent
and more valuable trees have reached a
suitable height. Of course, a stream of water cannot
always be diverted so as to make it pass the
place, but a fair substitute may be had by the construction
of a pond. And this thing should be accomplished
at the earliest possible moment. If
there be a small dry ravine, dam it up with concrete
and catch it full of surplus water during a rainy
season. It is a positive injustice to boys and not a
little unfair to girls to require them to grow up without
any access to open water of some kind. And it is
almost a matter of criminal neglect to require chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>dren
to live permanently in a home about which
there are no trees growing. So it is recommended,
even if the house construction must in part be delayed
or cut off, that the surroundings just named
be sought in all earnestness.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The house plan</span></h4>

<p>In planning and arranging the house, the matters
to be thought of in addition to those named above
are convenience and comfort. While it is somewhat
important that the house look well to those who may
be passing upon the highway, it is vastly more important
that it be good within and serve such needs
of the home-maker and the children as will conserve
the strength of the former and render the lives of all
happy and contented. In addition to the matters
just named, that of placing the dwelling to face in the
right direction will be thought of. That is, arrange
the house so as to take advantage of the morning
sunlight, the evening shade, the winter blasts and
the summer breezes. While for the sake of entertainment
it may be well to place the rural dwelling near
the public highway, rather than sacrifice the child-developing
factors of shade trees and streams and
the like, it is often better to build back from the road
and make a private lane leading thereto.</p>

<p>In arranging for the heat and light in the house,
think first of all of the health and sanitation of the
family. Ordinarily, the windows of the farmhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
are too small; while worse still, many of them, even
in the bed chambers, are permanently nailed down.
So, if the health and the general well-being of the
boys and girls, as well as the parents, are worth
anything at all, attend religiously to these small and
inexpensive conveniences, not neglecting to provide
most carefully for keeping out flies and other insects.
The wise farmer will find the secret of getting along
with his own household and of rearing a strong,
healthy family to lie in the strict attention he gives
to just such small matters as these. The things
that overstrain the physique, that try the temper and
patience of the housewife, must especially be looked
after and something of a better nature substituted
for them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How one farmer does it</span></h4>

<p>Mr. W. F. Mottier, living in Ford County, Illinois,
gives in <i>Farmer&#8217;s Voice</i> his plan of providing for the
children, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always tried to farm intelligently. One
of my favorite ideas in regard to farm life is that of
making the home as attractive as possible for the
children. So I put on the place all the modern improvements
that I can afford, in order that the
children may not feel that town life is the best.
And our children do not have any desire to go to
town. It would bring a sad thought to me to hear
my children talk against the farm life or home life on
the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Outbuildings and equipment</span></h4>

<p>With few exceptions, the money available for
building the home should be expended first in putting
the house into the ideal condition just named.
After that, if any means remain, the outbuildings
may be constructed. Otherwise, crude, temporary
arrangements may easily suffice. There is one thing,
however, that must be provided with scrupulous care
and that is the water for the household use. It
must be, first of all, wholesome and comparatively
free from impurities. Then, if at all possible, it
should be cool and taste well. Actual records have
shown that one will not drink enough water to satisfy
the demands of his health in case the taste be in any
degree unpleasant to him. So the ideal water for
household use is comparatively soft, is cool, highly
pleasing to the taste, and is free from disease-carrying
germs. This comparatively simple matter of providing
the water will prove most important in relation
to the well-being of the household and the up-building
of the family life. See to it at any cost
that the well be situated out of the way of seepage
from any barn or outbuilding, even though it may
from such necessity be placed somewhat out of the
reach of convenience.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Human rights prior to animal rights</span></h4>

<p>If the farmer cannot afford to erect a good barn he
may take reasonable care of his horses with the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of a cheap, improvised one. Actual test will show
that horses may be made comfortable in the summer
time with the use of a straw-thatched shed for a
barn, provided the drainage be reasonably good and
the earth floor be kept in good order. The thatched
covering may be made to keep out the rain. During
the winter, with the use of a few slender poles, the
entire shed may be inclosed with a hay or straw wall
and the place thus be made very satisfactory for the
time being. Similar sheds and protection may be
provided for the other live-stock, all to await the
time when the means are at hand for better conveniences.
It is especially suggestive of a mean lack
of consideration of human rights in the case of the
farmer who has a big, expensive farm barn towering
up beside a little dingy shanty of a dwelling house.
And yet this thing is all too common, particularly
in new prairie regions. Such is the place out of
which beastliness and criminality and anarchy tend
to be germinated from the lives of boys and girls, to
say nothing about the hidden tragedies that surround
the lives of the many women who are forced to put
up with such an arrangement for half a lifetime.</p>

<p>Just one illustration of a situation of the sort described
will suffice to point out the moral. On an
occasion two strangers drew up to a farmhouse.
One of them was a land agent, and the other a home
seeker. Their mission was that of purchasing a
farm. The owner of the farm showed them about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the place with considerable enthusiasm, but his heart
swelled with pride when he reached the magnificent
barn, one side of which was devoted to the propagation
of a high-grade strain of Duroc Jersey swine.
Every convenience and comfort for the hogs was
provided. He boasted about his success with them,
showed an affectionate regard for the different individuals,
calling them by name. The horses, too,
might have aroused the envy of the entire neighborhood.
They were sleek and well-fed, full in flesh
and fair in form. There was provided every convenience
for feeding and caring for the horses and
the hogs, so that the hired men found the work
about the barn exceedingly easy and pleasant.</p>

<p>Then the attention of the visitors was turned to the
farmhouse. Yes, it was small and run down and
poor, the intention being to build a larger one &#8220;some
time.&#8221; But that same intention was known to
have been expressed repeatedly for a period of
twenty years past. And where were the boys?
Well, that was the trouble, and furnished the excuse
for his willingness to sell the place. He simply
could not induce the boys to stay there and take an
interest in things. Two of them, barely more than
boys, had left the home nest in its meanness and
degradation and hired out in town. The mother
of the boys was living there because she had to, but
upon her face were lines of suffering and disappointment
and degradation. Yet in the midst of it all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
strange to say, the father seemed to blame the boys
and their mother for having conspired against the
interests of the farm home and plotted to get away.
In the course of his conversation he made it somewhat
evident that he would have sold out and left sooner
had the other members of the family not been so
urgent about the matter, and that he was now holding
on partly to indulge his spite and feeling of stubbornness
in reference to them.</p>

<p>The cheap novels one may pick up depict many a
fictitious tragedy. But in the place just described
lies the typical scene of thousands of real tragedies
during the course of which numberless lives of boys
and girls have been wrecked forever,&mdash;lives latent
with possibilities of goodness and beauty, of mental
and moral strength. And then, the bitterness and
anguish of soul of the mothers of these lost members
of a high humanity&mdash;what of that? The silent
walls of an untimely grave in many cases closed them
in, while much of the memory of their secret suffering
lies buried with them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The children&#8217;s room</span></h4>

<p>Even though the means available will not allow
for more than the humblest sort of cottage, there
should be definite thought of providing therein
some room or niche or corner to be considered as
the private property of the children. In a three-room
dwelling on the Kansas prairie in which lives a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
happy family of five, and about which thrifty young
shade trees and orchards are growing, there may be
seen a children&#8217;s room that would surprise and inspire
any ordinary observer. In a little attic room
facing the east and reached by a mere step-ladder
arrangement, may be found the &#8220;den,&#8221; which is the
private place of the three children. A small window
opens out to the east and a small improvised
dormer window about twelve by twenty inches admits
light and air from the south. There is no plastering
or other expensive covering upon the sloping
roof walls, but the artistic mother has provided dainty
white muslin for concealing the rough places, and
with the help of the children she has decorated the
little room in a manner that would attract the very
elect. None of this has required a money cost, but
it has all been done beautifully at the expense of
thought and good sense and artistic taste, prompted
by rare consideration for the needs of the boys and
girls.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate VI.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_6" name="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/plate_vi.png" width="500" height="317" alt="" title="Plate VI" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;A commodious farmhouse in Canada, equipped throughout with a complete water system. Many
farmers waste enough trying to build a house without a modern plan to pay for this extra convenience.</span>
</div>

<p>The two little girls and their brother, ranging in
age from five to ten years, spend many a happy hour
in their attic chamber. The heat from the room
below comes through a small aperture and warms
the little place in winter time, while the breeze passes
through the little windows in summer, tempering
the room satisfactorily excepting upon extremely hot
days. Upon the walls are arranged beautiful post
cards, larger pictures gathered from magazines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
other sources, and small though beautiful home
decorations of every conceivable sort. The little
seven-year-old boy has a small assortment of curios
collected from the hills and streams, while the girls
have a small display of their childish needlework,
their dolls, and some of their best school drawings.
How suggestive and how helpful it would be if this
little den could be displayed before the eyes of all the
humble cottagers throughout the rural districts!</p>

<p>Yes, the hogs may live out-of-doors and the horses
get along very well indeed with a temporary barn
thatched with straw, but the places of the boys and
girls must be looked after and that in the interest
of making them happy, of filling their lives with
every good, clean sentiment, and of preparing them
for that large sphere of usefulness which may mark
their future. If the house be larger than the one
we have described, then provide accordingly for
the children. Give them a good room of their own.
Put their ornaments and playthings in it. If there
be space, provide a library containing a few suitable
volumes. And after this thoughtful provision has
been made, see to it carefully that their schedule for
work, schooling, and the other duties allows for ample
time and opportunity for their enjoyment of the
apartment set aside for them. In years to come,
that sweet poetic sentiment running back to the home
of one&#8217;s childhood will be given greater strength and
beauty because of the fact that this thing just urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
has been done. And more than that, the man (or
woman) who has the blessed privilege of recalling
these bygone scenes of childhood receives from such
contemplation a new sense of inner strength and new
enduement of power to go on with life&#8217;s struggle
and master the larger problems that come to him.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The evening hour</span></h4>

<p>No matter what the cares of the day may have
been, how many things may have gone wrong, how
much hay left out in the field unprotected from the
rain, how many acres of corn unplowed and losing
in the battle with the weeds, how many items of
household duties unperformed&mdash;there is every justification
for laying aside these work-a-day affairs
at the approach of bedtime and for the spending of
a precious hour with the problems of the children.
Farm parents as well as other parents can thus
preserve their youth and add immeasurably to the
joys of their own lives. This thing of being with
the children at evening may seem slightly awkward
and prosaic at first, but it will slowly grow into a
habit and will become transformed into an experience
of great charm and beauty. Best of all the
high refinement, potential in the lives of the children,
will thus be gradually brought to an expression, and
the foundation stones of substantial manhood and
womanhood will be laid in their lives. Yes, it is
true, even farm parents may learn to lay aside their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
cares and perplexities and enjoy the splendid privilege
of getting intimately acquainted with the hopes
and desires and aspirations of their boys and girls!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
<i>JUVENILE LITERATURE IN THE FARM
HOME</i></h3>


<p>It may be truly said that the strength and
impressiveness of the personality depend on the
nature of the inner thought of the individual. Now,
thoughts are not unlike the trees and the growing
grain, or, for that matter, any other living thing;
unless they have proper nourishment they wither,
perish, or dwindle away to a puny shadow of their
possible selves. How shall we measure the strength
and force of the human character other than by the
bigness and the purity of the daily thoughts of the
individual? It matters little what the occupation
may be&mdash;a hewer of stone, a hauler of wood, a captain
of industry, or a governor of a state&mdash;each of
these may be mean and little in his respective position
provided his thoughts be sensuous and groveling.
On the other hand, each of these can shine in
his allotted place in a light all his own, provided he
have the habit of entertaining clean and inspiring
ideas in his secret consciousness.</p>

<p>Now, one of the larger problems of the rural life
is that of supplying the many hours necessarily de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>voted
to silent reflection with a suitable form of
thought culture. Proverbially, the farmer and his
wife and their children are hurried along with the
work-a-day affairs and tend gradually to acquire the
non-reading habit. This is bad for the parents in
that it keeps their minds running around upon a
little cycle of hard, industrial facts. It is worse for
the children in that it fails to supply the proper
nourishment for the dream period through which
their lives are necessarily passing. What can be
done, therefore, to nourish and build up the best
possible thought activities, especially in case of the
rural boys and girls?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How good thinking grows up and flourishes</span></h4>

<p>It may not be out of place to show here somewhat
more definitely how attractive forms of literature
gradually work themselves into the lives of the
young. In the first place, the young person cannot
invent his own ideas. He does not manufacture his
thoughts out of something latent within his organism.
The latent situation consists merely of a nervous
system prepared to receive manifold impressions and
to retain them and give them back through the process
of ideation. That is, the young person thinks
only about things that have actually happened in
his life. All he knows has come to him through the
avenue of his senses; what he has seen and heard and
felt, and so on, constitutes the &#8220;stuff&#8221; out of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
his thoughts are made. So he must have the widest
possible experience, while young, in the use of his
natural senses.</p>

<p>The literature best adapted to the child would be
that which appeals to the interests predominating
in his life at any given time. During his early years
not hard, prosaic facts, but situations that stretch
the truth and sport with the fixed condition of things
are especially appealing to him. He should therefore
be indulged in the classic myths, fables, fairy
tales, and the like. The parent will of course be
on guard against his acquiring any seriously erroneous
beliefs in respect to such things, and also against
his receiving any serious shock or fright from the
tragic aspects of the tale. Later on, during the early
teens, the boys and girls will become more and more
interested in the stories of the wars of old and in the
fact and romance of history. Stories supplementing
the text-book history of the home country may now
be introduced.</p>

<p>As a possible means of bringing the minds of the
boys and girls into a more intimate knowledge of the
rural situation, nature studies and nature stories
should be offered. It must be remembered that it is
quite possible for the boy to grow up within a stone&#8217;s
throw of many of the living things of nature and yet
scarcely recognize their presence, much less know
anything definite about them. Therefore, nature-study
books and leaflets written perhaps in story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
form and containing attractive illustrations of the
birds, bees, flowers, and trees to be found near about
the rural home will prove most interesting and
instructive to the young. Through such helpful
literature the mind will gradually acquire the habit of
casting about in the home environment for the description
of possible objects and conditions new to one.</p>

<p>One of the best and most helpful results accruing
to the young person who indulges the habit of reading
good literature is this: he acquires a large vocabulary
of words and phrases in which to clothe his
secret thought and with which to express himself to
others. All this furnishes, not merely a splendid
form of entertainment for the silent reflections, but
it also gives the thinker a sense of the power and the
worth of his own personality.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Types of literature</span></h4>

<p>It may be stated as a foregone conclusion that no
farm is well equipped for the happiness and well-being
of those who dwell thereon unless there be an
ample supply of good literature in the house. No
matter how well stocked with high-grade farm animals,
how productive in point of farm crops, how well
kept the hedges and lanes may be, secret poverty and
littleness of mind lurk in that home if the literature
is wanting. So, first of all, let us lay the foundation
by means of enumerating some periodicals and books
of a more general nature.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate VII.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_7" name="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/plate_vii.png" width="500" height="303" alt="" title="Plate VII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;It is a mistake to try to make bookworms of children. Many of their best books are &#8220;green
fields and running brooks,&#8221; also frequent opportunity to play together in groups and neighborhoods.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>1. <i>The best reading.</i>&mdash;Of course the Bible might
head the list. Whether or not there be a large
&#8220;family&#8221; Bible, there should be at least a text of
convenient size and form for everyday use. This
book should contain a good concordance.</p>

<p>Then there should come into the home a first-class
weekly newspaper; possibly the local paper
will supply this need. Many farm homes now receive
a daily paper regularly.</p>

<p>In addition there should be available a weekly or
monthly summary of the current events of the nation
and the world. The <i>Literary Digest</i>, the <i>World&#8217;s
Work</i>, and the <i>Review of Reviews</i> are examples of
standard magazines of this particular class. Either
one of them will stimulate most helpfully the quiet
thought of the farmer and the members of his family
and keep one in touch with the most important movements
of the country.</p>

<p>Along with the foregoing, there should be kept
constantly at hand a first-class farm magazine.
There are numberless periodicals of this sort, but
perhaps among those of the first rank and those
which especially give definite helps for the boy-and-girl
life of the farm may be mentioned <i>Wallaces&#8217;
Farmer</i>, Des Moines, Iowa, the <i>Farmer&#8217;s Voice</i>,
Chicago, Illinois, and the <i>Farmer&#8217;s Guide</i>, Huntington,
Indiana. Also, the semi-official state paper
well known in many of the commonwealths is usually
very helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>Look out for trash. There are many papers
published, ostensibly in the interest of farm life,
which are in fact cheap and trashy sheets made use
of almost wholly as a medium of advertising quack
medicines, get-rich-quick schemes, and other frauds.
A reliable means of testing the value of any one of
these so-called &#8220;farm&#8221; or &#8220;home&#8221; papers is to
examine the advertisements. If there be any considerable
number of advertisements which offer
sure cures for chronic diseases, confidential treatments
for secret troubles, fortune telling, and attractive
high-priced articles at a trifling cost, then
the whole thing is probably fraudulent and not
worthy to come into your home. Also avoid the
paper or magazine which advertises intoxicating
liquors. It is very low in moral tone, to say the
least.</p>

<p>2. <i>Books for children.</i>&mdash;In selecting a list of
books for farm boys and girls, we should make little
or no distinction between them and the children of
the city homes. Their earlier literary needs are
practically all alike and their youthful minds must
be nourished in about the same fashion. In offering
the lists to follow we do not pretend to have
selected nearly all the profitable books available, but
rather to have named a few examples of volumes
already found enticing and helpful to the young
mind. The majority of them are standard and well
known. While the price and publisher are given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
many instances, often a cheaper edition may be
had.</p>

<p>In order to proceed with greater certainty and
economy in purchasing books for the children, the
rural parent is advised to consult some one near at
hand who is thoroughly familiar with children&#8217;s
literature. Perhaps the superintendent of schools
of the town near by, or some local minister, or some
well-informed leader of a mothers&#8217; club, may furnish
the desired assistance. It would also be helpful
to write for the general catalogues of a number of
the large publishing and distributing houses and
from their lists select a number of suitable titles.
Many of them publish the older classics in very
attractive form for ten to twenty-five cents, the original
unchanged and unabridged.</p>

<p>In order to stimulate interest in forming the nucleus
of a home library the farmer should either
make or purchase a small set of book shelves. Important
as it may seem to build a first-class house for
the thoroughbred hogs, this matter of the children&#8217;s
reading is even more important and should be attended
to first, before it becomes too late to catch
the attentive ear of the boys and girls.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, there is beginning to come from the press
a mass of juvenile literature that promises to furnish most practical
inspiration and guidance to the juvenile mind on the farm. Much of
this new rural life literature may be had for the asking or for the mere
price of publication. The following are recommended:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Rural School Leaflet.</i> Edited by Alice G. McCloskey, and
issued under the general direction of L. H. Bailey at Ithaca, N.Y.</p>

<p>The Country Life Publications, issued by D. W. Working, Superintendent
of Agricultural Extension, Morgantown, W.Va.</p>

<p>The series published by A. B. Graham, Superintendent of the Extension
Department, Ohio University, Columbus.</p>

<p>The annual reports of County Superintendent O. J. Kern, Rockford,
Ill., and of County Superintendent George W. Brown, Paris, Ill.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin Arbor and Bird Day Annual, issued by State Superintendent
C. P. Cary, Madison, Wis.</p>

<p>The Extension Departments of many of the state universities and
nearly all of the state agricultural colleges are now issuing a series of
small pamphlets on such matters as stock judging, grain breeding, soil
testing, and home economics. This literature should be given the
widest possible circulation in the country home, as it will prove helpful
both to the young and to the parents in their direction of the young.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Literature on Child-rearing</i></p>

<p>Parents who are seriously in earnest in the matter of developing the
lives of their children will find great assistance and much inspiration
through the reading of books and magazines on the child-rearing problems.
In fact, it may be put down as a practical certainty that the work
of child training cannot go on effectively and continue in its interest
except one have some aids of the kind just named. Therefore, the interested
parent should cast about for the books and magazines that
promise to serve in the solution of the particular problems at hand. It
happens that the author has collected a large number of books and periodicals
of this class and that he has made a somewhat critical examination
of them.</p>

<p>There was never a greater demand for efficient
leadership in the rural communities than there is
to-day. The country has continued for many years
past to become richer in farm products and equipment,
but it has steadily grown poorer in social and
spiritual values. In fact we have unconsciously
acquired a distorted idea of values. Hogs are too high
in proportion to boys. Beef cattle are absorbing too
much interest in proportion to the time and money
expended in perfecting the character of girls. It
has long been the proud boast of the Middle Western
states that they could feed the entire country. And
we have continued so long in this way as now to
regard big crops and the great abundance of farm
animals and other such material possessions as ends
in themselves. So it is high time that we ask ourselves
what this material wealth is all for. Looked
at from at least one high vantage point, it may be
properly regarded as so much encumbrance unless we
shall be able to convert it into a means to some
worthy and spiritual purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Decadence of rural life</span></h4>

<p>The open country in the Middle Western states
has for some time been the breeding place for sterling
manhood and ideal womanhood, and the recruiting
ground wherefrom have been drawn many men and
women to undertake the management of the larger
enterprises of the country. The enforced self
denial and discipline of work; the continued practice
of quiet reflection; the comparative freedom from
the evil and degrading influences peculiar to much of
the child life in the cities; and many other character-building
experiences could be set down on the favorable
side of rural child-rearing in the past. But this
situation is rapidly changing. The ten-year period
just closing has witnessed a decadence of country life,
the rural population actually showing a decrease.
Large numbers of the best families have moved to the
cities and towns, and their places on the farm have
been taken by irresponsible laborers and transient
renters.</p>

<p>Yes, the wealth of the rural community is still
there, lying more or less dormant, and all the other
means of a splendid civilization are there. But in
the usual instance there is no one to assume the
leadership in bringing about the reconstruction of
the rural life. Now that he has accumulated such
an abundance of material things, the typical farmer
needs to be shown how to deal more fairly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
helpfully with the various members of his family.
Some farmers&#8217; wives are gradually being dragged to
death with the over-burden of work, which might be
obviated if the farmer and his wife were both shown
specifically a better way of getting things done.
Many boys and girls growing up in the country are
being cheated out of their natural heritage of good
health, spontaneous play, and the joy of social intercourse,
all because of the fact that farm products are
too much regarded as an end rather than a means
to the higher development of the members of the
rural family. So a good soil and excellent crops are
essentials for a substantial rural society, but they are
not a certain evidence of such thing. It is possible
to go into some of the country communities where
these material things are accumulated in great
abundance and yet find the people there living a
little, mean, and narrow form of life, and that chiefly
because they do not quite understand how to use
the splendid means at hand in the accomplishment
of some high and worthy purposes.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Work for the ministry</span></h4>

<p>And so we hereby issue a call and a challenge for
workers to enter the great fallow field just named
and make it blossom with new social and spiritual life.
And it is the conviction of some that the ministers
of the town and village churches can undertake this
work much better than any other class of persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
for they are already in many respects trained leaders.
Let these ministers be provided if possible with an
assistant, a layman it may be, for both their town
and country work. Then let each of them have a
rural appointment to which they may go from one
to four times each month; and, inspired by a
vision of all the possibilities ahead of them and
endued with divine power and guidance, enter
earnestly into the great work of rehabilitating the
country community. It is evident that the minister
who will leave his town congregation with perhaps
only one Sunday sermon and go to a country church
and preach to the adults, and teach and lead the
young, while his assistant takes charge of the second
Sunday service at home&mdash;it is evident that such a
minister will not only wear longer in the locality
in which he is stationed, but that he will find in the
rural work just mentioned such a flood of zeal and
inspiration as will more than make up for and
repay the effort. Many of the town ministers are
preaching to audiences that are more or less irresponsive
to what they have to say. Under present conditions
they are compelled to preach to the same
audiences too much. Their sermons grow stale.
But under the arrangement here recommended,
such conditions would not obtain. They would come
back from the rural appointment so laden with
new ideas and ideals as to appear to the home
congregation in a most advantageous light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The country minister</span></h4>

<p>There is at present not a little promise that there
may be developed throughout the country a new
type of country-dwelling ministers. It is certainly a
logical position for the effective religious worker to
assume; namely, that of actually dwelling among
those whom he is attempting to serve. He acquires
an intimate knowledge of their problems, their
point of view, including the status of their individual
beliefs and prejudices.</p>

<span class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.&mdash;The new country church at Plainfield, Illinois, erected through
the inspiration and leadership of Reverend Matthew B. McNutt.</span>
</div>

<p>As an example of what the country minister can
achieve one needs to read an account of the splendid
work of the Rev. Mathew B. McNutt of Plainfield,
Illinois. Mr. McNutt was called to this charge
in 1900 when a fresh graduate from a Presbyterian
seminary. At the time of his call there was in
the locality a small dead or nominal church membership
and an occasional weak, ineffective service
held in the little old church of fifty years&#8217; standing.
This devoted and far-seeing man got down among
the people with whom he settled, made a careful
survey of the economic, the social, and the religious
life of the place, and began his wonderful work of
reconstructing all this. The ultimate purpose was
the improvement of the spiritual well-being. He
organized singing schools, granges, literary and debating
societies, sewing societies, and clubs of various
other sorts, all as a means of awakening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
life of the community and bringing the people together
in a spirit of mutual sympathy and helpfulness.
After less than a decade of hard work a
marvelous transformation of the rural life thereabout
was achieved. Among other notable changes was a
new church to supplant the old one. The new
building was erected at a cash cost of ten thousand
dollars; has an audience room seating five hundred
or more, several Sunday school class rooms, a choir
room, a cloak room, a pastor&#8217;s study and a mothers&#8217;
room, all on the main floor. In the basement below
there is a good kitchen, a dining room with equipment,
also a furnace, a store room, and the like.
The church membership has grown to one hundred
sixty-three with many non-members attending,
while the Sunday school enrollment increased to
three hundred.</p>

<p>Now there are always a few minds who wish to
measure all earthly things in terms of a money
value. To such it may be shown that the land
values in the vicinity of this new country church
have gone up to a marked degree and that the
economic conditions are all of a most satisfactory
nature.</p>

<p>As further evidence of what a rural community
working together may achieve for the spiritual
welfare, there may be cited the instance of the little
side station by the name of Ogden in Riley County,
Kansas. Here the people got together and voted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
build a country church, and that without determining
as to the denominational affiliation. A committee
of leaders was appointed to raise funds and to draw
plans for the building. In a short time, arrangements
were perfected for constructing the building at a
cost of four thousand dollars. It was later voted
to place this new church temporarily under the direction
of the Congregational church in Manhattan,
fifteen miles away.</p>

<p>In one or two instances the religious leaders in
a country community have succeeded admirably in
establishing a &#8220;commission&#8221; form of church administration.
The method pursued has been that
of having a committee of three, each a member of a
different church, to call by turn from the towns
near by the ministers of the various denominations.
Further details of the plans provide for the committee
to raise funds so that the minister may be paid a
definite amount for the service conducted.</p>

<p>One of the first essential steps in the establishment
of a rural church is a careful survey or study of the
situation. While it may be accounted a sin against
God and humanity to add another church where there
are already more than the people can support, often
it will be found that very large, well populated
country districts are wholly without access to any
religious service whatever. Verily, the field is
white unto the harvest and the laborers as yet are
few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A mistake in training</span></h4>

<p>Too long we have been training young people in
the school and in the home to struggle for the best
of everything&mdash;a sort of rivalry that results in
envy, jealousy, and strife, and a falling apart where
there should be co&#246;peration and sympathy and a
spirit of mutual helpfulness. The craze for clothes,
the glare of the electric lights, and the lure of the
cheap theater have struck the country people and
are drawing away much of the best young blood
there. It seems that we have over-done this thing
of pointing to the top and urging our young people
to scramble for that, until as a result no one is
looking for a place to serve, while all are looking for
a place to shine. Now, there may be &#8220;plenty of
room at the top&#8221; for selfish scrambling, but in some
respects the top is woefully over-crowded. On the
other hand, there is a vast amount of good room
at the bottom, acres of it, and we might well commend
it to every one who may be imbued with the
idea of doing some effective work in the world.
All over the broad, open country, in thousands of
rural districts, the situation at the bottom is literally
crying out for constructive workers who will come in
there with their good courage, their scientific training,
and in the name of the Most High get down
among the people and the common things in the
midst of which the people live and lay a substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
foundation for a new and beautiful structure&mdash;an
edifice erected out of the plain materials to be found
in any ordinary rural community, and that by means
of transforming such things and making them
contributive to the high and lofty spirit-purposes
for which they are really designed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rural child-rearing</span></h4>

<p>We are not half awake as yet to the meaning and
possibilities of the rural community as a place
for rearing children. The city environment ripens
youths too fast and too early and works all the
spontaneity and aggressiveness out of the boys
and girls before their mature judgments are ready
to function. As a result of this city hot-bed, we
have as a type the blas&#233; sort of young man, and a
young woman who is overly smart in respect to the
&#8220;proper things to do.&#8221; Either of them has little
power of initiative and less power of persistence.
One of the greatest virtues of the somewhat isolated
rural home is that it matures human character more
slowly and keeps the boys and girls fresh and &#8220;green&#8221;
and spontaneous while there is being gradually
worked into their characters the habit of industry
and the power of doing constructive work.</p>

<p>If one should desire to obtain a sterling specimen
of manhood, he would not take up with the &#8220;smart&#8221;
city youth who at the age of sixteen has had all
the experiences known to men. The latter is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ripe. He knows it all. From his own point of view,
his knowledge of the world is nearly completed. No,
one would prefer to go to the most remote country
district and, if need be, lasso some green, gawky,
sixteen-year-old who is afraid of the cars and the
big girls and who has never had a suit of clothes that
fits him. This scared, unbroken youth would go
through a tremendous amount of rough-and-tumble,
trial-and-error experiences during the course of his
college training; and he would live intensively and
rush into many unknown places and commit many
blunders, between whiles catching countless inspiring
visions of how he might be or become a man
of great strength and ruggedness of character.
Such a man might be relied upon to shoulder the
heavy burdens of the world. Such a man could be
called out to join in the forefront of battle when the
moral and religious rights of the people were at issue.
Such a man when fully matured could be sent into
some kind of missionary field and be expected to
labor there for a long time alone, courageous and
persistent, finally winning a very small following;
then a larger number of adherents; and then the
entire population at his heels, applauding and backing
him up in his every worthy effort.</p>

<p>The author has long had a vision of a man trained
and developed through the seasoning experiences
just sketched and who, under the inspiration and the
guidance of the Most High, will go into these rural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
communities which are latent with material life,
and there begin his labors in behalf of the higher
things into which all the elements of this typical
rural situation may be transformed. Just as fast
as men hear this divine call and heed it and take up
this work, so fast will our country life be reconstructed
and the best that is in our society become
gloriously transformed and everlastingly saved as a
heritage of the oncoming generations. And it is
evident that the rural minister, working through
the rural church, is the person to whom this divine call
may most naturally come.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The churches too narrow</span></h4>

<p>Not a few of the country churches are too narrow
in their limitations, tending to chill out those who do
not happen to be adherents of the creed, and to
foster dissensions and hatred among neighbors.
And they are not touching in a vital way the lives
of country boys and girls.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate IX.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.&mdash;This attractive and modern church building was erected by the Christian people living
in the vicinity of the country village of Ogden, Kansas. Four different denominations participated
at its dedication. Its ruling body is undenominational.</span>
</div>

<p>It will be agreed that the gospel of the Master of
men may be made so broad and inviting as to attract
all who have a spark of religion in their natures,
and that means practically every one in the community.
But there is no good reason why the rural
church should stand alone as such. It should and
can be made a social as well as a religious center for
the whole community. So, let there be constructed
a modern building with big windows, and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
apartments for Sunday school classes, and for meetings
of social groups, such as the grange, the farmers&#8217;
institute, the sewing society, and the literary and
debating clubs. Then there should be apparatus
for the preparation of meals, with a room in which a
long table might be spread as occasion demands.
Outside of this building there should be a children&#8217;s
playground with some simple apparatus for play.</p>

<p>Not less frequently than one afternoon of the
month&mdash;and twice would be better&mdash;the people
of the community should drop everything and come
together for a good social time and a general exchange
of ideas. On an occasion of this kind the
town minister could be present or someone from
the outside who would bring with him at least one
helpful and practical idea about building up country
life. Let this building be regarded as the property of
every man, woman, and child in the community and
strive to bring it to pass that the legitimate and worthy
interest of all shall be actually served there.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Constructive work of the church</span></h4>

<p>This country church here thought of need be no
less a religious affair, but it must become distinctively
a socializing agency. It must not merely save
souls, but it must save and conserve and develop
for this present life the bodily, the moral, and the
intellectual powers of the young. One cannot adequately
develop those splendid latent powers in young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
people solely by means of teaching them the Sunday
school lesson or preaching to them, no matter how
true the gospel may be. The evidence is ample
to show that boys and girls who attend church and
Sunday school are nevertheless falling into many
vicious habits of conduct, and are growing up without
many of the forms of discipline and training essential
for stable Christian character and social and moral
efficiency. In fact as a means of temporal salvation
the old-fashioned church and Sunday school are
proving more and more a failure.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as the church realizes the meaning
of the foregoing situation and acts accordingly, just
so soon will this splendid old institution be enabled
to do efficient work in vitalizing the practical affairs
of the community in which it is located. To illustrate
this point: The great curse of boyhood to-day
is the tobacco habit, and this vitiating practice
is slowly working its way among the country youth.
The youth who acquires the smoking habit before
becoming physically matured thereby depletes his
physical health to a marked degree, reduces his
mental efficiency ten to fifty per cent, and almost
completely destroys his power of initiative. Such
a youth is never found contending for any moral
issue or any high and worthy cause of the people.
His constructive instinct is made more quiescent,
while his disposition to condone evil is greatly and
permanently increased. Boys who attend church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and Sunday school are also, like others, falling victims
to the sex evils of various forms.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">An innovation in the rural church</span></h4>

<p>Perhaps there is no better illustration of how the
economic affairs of the neighborhood may be vitally
linked with the church service than the work carried
on under the direction of Superintendent George
W. Brown, of Paris, Illinois. During one year Mr.
Brown conducted on seven different occasions an
over-Sunday program, somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Saturday either at the country school house or
in the basement of the country church there was
arranged an exhibition of corn, while during the
day class exercises in the study of corn were in
progress. On the day following, Sunday, there were
two sermons, the theme of each being closely allied
to the economic problems studied the day previously.
The ministers are reported to have co&#246;perated
enthusiastically in this work, each one attempting
in his sermon to show how better economic life
may be made contributive to a better religious
life.</p>

<p>On the Monday following, the program was continued
with a farmers&#8217; institute representative of the
several interests of the adults and the young people.
At this Monday meeting a number of the faculty
of the state university were in attendance and gave
helpful addresses appropriate to the occasion. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
night the County Superintendent gave an illustrated
lecture, using the stereopticon to show the audience
just what was being done in the various parts of
the county and country by way of improvement of
the social and economic conditions.</p>

<p>In many places in the New England and other
eastern states the rural communities are attacking
the social-religious problems in practically the same
manner as is being done at Plainfield, Illinois. At
Danbury, New Hampshire, there is a Country Settlement
Association, which is accomplishing some
epoch-making things. At the official building there
is provided a trained nurse to assist the entire
community. The organization conducts social-betterment
work for the local neighborhood and
leads in a campaign for social reform throughout
the state.</p>

<p>Likewise, at Lincoln, Vermont, there is an interesting
example of co&#246;peration between the religious
and social interests. Three churches have
formed a federated society. In a building maintained
in common by them, the meetings of the
Ladies&#8217; Aid Society, the Good Templars, the
Grange, the Grand Army Post, and many others
of a social nature are held. Such co&#246;perative work
is certain to have a helpful and far-reaching effect
on any community.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Spiritualize child life</span></h4>

<p>Above all things else, let the country church be
reorganized with reference to the interests of the
young. Let the minister and the other leaders take a
firm stand for a square deal for the farm boys and
girls in respect to work and play and sociability.
Let them place before country parents clear, concrete
models and methods as to how to accord fair treatment
to the children in every particular thing. Let
them organize the young people of the community
into groups for play and sociability and direct them
in both of these matters.</p>

<p>It is high time we were considering all of our legitimate
interests as a part of our religion. Indeed,
there is no good reason why the young people could
not meet together at the rural church and on the
same evening have an oyster supper and a prayer
meeting. They could very consistently discuss and
participate in both a temporal and a spiritual affair
on the same occasion and in such a way that each
part of the program would be vitalized by the others.
And likewise the smaller children. It should not be
considered at all irreverent for one to go directly
with them to the playground after the Sunday school
lesson is ended and there lead and direct them in their
health-giving enjoyments. Try this in your rural-church
society centers and see if the boys and girls
do not run with great enthusiasm to the whole affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>One great error committed by many of us in the
past is that of regarding work and things as arbitrarily
high or low. But the author does not see
why plowing corn may not be made just as sacred
and just as divine a calling as preaching the gospel,
provided the former be regarded in the light of service
of some high spiritual purpose; as indeed it may
be. So, here is a distinctive part of the function of
the rural church; namely, to spiritualize work as well
as workers&mdash;to urge upon the attention of the rural
inhabitants the thought that their work must all
be regarded as a means to the transformation of the
community life and of each individual life into a
thing of transcendent worth and beauty.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A summary</span></h4>

<p>Now, here is the proposed plan in a nutshell.
The country community is the best place in the world
for bringing up a sturdy race of men and women and
the country church is or can be made one of the
greatest agencies in the achievement of this work.
But such achievement can best be brought about
only when the country church goes to work to save
the whole boy and the whole girl. And that means
that the church must understand better how human
life grows up&mdash;that it must meet these growing boys
and girls on their own level of everyday interest and
socialize and spiritualize these interests through close
contact with them. Then, make the rural church a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
social center for the young, including exercises in
work and play and recreation, as well as a place for
religious instruction. The child is a creature of
activity and not of passivity. You cannot preach
him into the kingdom in a lifetime; but you can get
down with him and work with him and play with him
and guide and direct him through his self-chosen,
everyday interests, to the end that he may afterwards
enter the ranks of the Lord&#8217;s anointed.</p>

<p>Again, it is urged, make your country church a
center for the entire life of the community. Not
only have the adults bring their practical affairs to
this center for consideration, but have the boys and
girls come with their implements of work and play,
with their specimens of farm and home produce
and handiwork, with their miniature menageries and
workshops&mdash;all this with joy and reverence before
and after the religious services.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
<i>THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE RURAL
SCHOOL</i></h3>


<p>The country districts are slowly waking up to an
appreciation of the fact that within their bounds lie,
not only all the elements fundamental to the material
wealth of the world, but that they also contain in a
more or less dormant form all the essential factors of
intellectual and spiritual wealth. The rural school
is theoretically the best place on earth for the education
of the child, not only because of its close proximity
to the sources of material wealth, but because of
the openness and comparative freedom of its surroundings.
Then, the country school is especially
effective as a place of instruction on account of its
happy relation to work and industry. Too often the
boys and girls of the town school go unwillingly to
their class rooms with the feeling that the lessons are
heavily imposed tasks.</p>

<p>But in the typical country school the pupils are
young persons who have already experienced much of
the strain of work and who go somewhat eagerly to
the schoolroom, because it is in a sense recreative to
them, and because of their being in a position to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
more clearly what substantial training is to mean to
them in the future. That is to say, a distinctive
difference between the typical country child and the
typical city child is this: the former believes that he
is pursuing the course of instruction in a more voluntary
spirit and for the sake of his own personal interests
and up-building, while the latter is inclined
to feel that he is performing the school tasks for the
sake of some one else and because of the strict requirements
of outside force or law.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Radical changes in the view-point and method</span></h4>

<p>But if the theoretic worth of the rural school is
to be made at all actual, some very radical changes in
view-point and method must come to pass. First
of all, we must keep asking the question, What is
education for? And perhaps we must accept the
answer that in its best form education serves the
higher needs and requirements of the life we are
trying to live to-day. In case of rural teachers and
parents it has been too common a practice to urge
the child on in his lesson-getting with the statement,
or at least the suggestion, that lessons well mastered
in time furnish a guarantee of a life of comparative
ease and freedom from heavy toil. The sermonette
preached to the boy in this situation is too often
substantially as follows: &#8220;Go on, my boy, master
your lessons, pass up through the grades, and be
graduated. Behold So and So, a great captain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
wealth, and such and such a one, a great statesman.
Now, these persons are in a position to take life
easy. They have wealth to spend for the employment
of labor and need to do little of such thing
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, the view-point of the school has
been radically wrong. We have been advancing
the idea that education enables one to get <i>out of</i>
work, whereas we should have been urging that
education of the right sort enables one to get <i>into</i>
work. That is, it means enlarged capacity for work
and service and proportionately enlarged joy and contentment
in the performance of worthy work of any
nature whatsoever. Let rural parents once inculcate
the last-named point of view upon their growing
boys and girls and the attitude of the latter
toward the school and its tasks will be likewise radically
changed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">All have a right to culture</span></h4>

<p>And then, a second question we need to ask ourselves
is, Whom is education for? or, What classes
should have the benefits of it? A close comparison
of the school ideals of twenty-five years ago with the
most progressive ones of to-day reveals a surprising
situation. Without seemingly realizing the fact,
we continued for generations in this country to tax
ourselves heavily for the purpose of supporting
schools almost exclusively in behalf of the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
professional classes. We said, especially to the growing
boy: &#8220;Now, if you wish to become a lawyer, a
physician, a minister, or a teacher, here is your opportunity.
Pursue this well-arranged course, finish
it up, and that all at our expense. But if you wish
to become a farmer, a merchant, a craftsman of any
sort, then this institution is not at your service.
We will teach you to read and write and cipher, after
which you may look out for yourself.&#8221; Thus we were
taxing the masses for the exclusive education of a
few classes. To-day the best ideal is a radically
different one, as it attempts to serve all worthy
classes and vocations through the school administration.
It assumes that artisans as well as artists
and the professional classes have the same inherent
right to both the practical aid and the direct culture
which an educational course may furnish.</p>

<p>As a practical result of this new ideal, now rapidly
advancing throughout the country, we are about to
have an age of cultured farmers, high-minded stock
raisers, refined architects and builders, and so on.
That is, our newest and best educational courses
are beginning to provide the means and opportunities
for the education of all worthy classes. So it behooves
all interested rural parents to turn their best efforts
toward the transformation and the betterment of the
country school. Certain specific achievements in
relation thereto are now being planned for and in
many instances accomplished. Let every one con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>cerned
take notice of this situation and join with all
possible earnestness in the forward movement.</p>

<p>In his instructive monograph entitled &#8220;Changing
Conceptions of Education,&#8221; Professor E. P. Cubberley
states the new ideal as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The school is essentially a time- and labor-saving
device, created&mdash;with us&mdash;by democracy to
serve democracy&#8217;s needs. To convey to the next
generation the knowledge and the accumulated experience
of the past is not its only function. It
must equally prepare the future citizen for the to-morrow
of our complex life. The school must grasp
the significance of its social connections and relations,
and must come to realize that its real worth
and its hope of adequate reward lie in its social
efficiency. There are many reasons for believing
that this change is taking place rapidly at present,
and that an educational sociology, needed as much
by teachers to-day as an educational psychology, is
now in the process of being formulated for our use.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Work for a longer term</span></h4>

<p>One of the first steps toward a more helpful schooling
for the country youth is that of lengthening the
yearly school term. In many thousands of instances,
the country school is conducted for only three to five
months during the year, and even this short term is
indifferently attended. But the actual length of the
year should be seven months or more. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
country districts can easily provide for eight months.
The farmer should not concern himself about a small
additional tax, but should have in mind rather the
larger additional gain to the well-being of the young
in the community. If the local tax be not sufficient
for supporting a longer term and a better school,
then seek to have laws authorizing the distribution
of state aid to the weaker districts. This law has
been actually passed in a number of the commonwealths.
The act in the usual case provides a general
school fund out of which the deficit for the smaller
rural districts may be made up.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Compulsory attendance laws needed</span></h4>

<p>The far-seeing country dweller will be glad to join
in a movement in behalf of compulsory attendance at
the public schools. Already a number of states have
enacted fairly good laws on this subject, but some
of them allow &#8220;loopholes&#8221; providing for the too
easy avoidance of their requirements. Perhaps the
best and most effective type of law of this class is
that which requires the child under fourteen years of
age to attend the entire term of the public schools,
allowing for his absence only in case of sickness or in
cases where it is shown upon investigation and beyond
question that he is the main support and breadwinner
of a family.</p>

<p>In connection with the legal requirements for compulsory
attendance, there must, of course, be provi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>sion
for the truant. Truant officers, who may be required
to serve only part time and who may receive
pay for actual services, are set over specified districts
and required to bring in all truant school
children. Although this compulsory attendance law
has been in force only a few years, reports show an
almost unanimous belief in its effectiveness. The
reader will understand the justification of such a
law to be this; namely, the inherent right of the
child to be educated whether he may appreciate such
right or advantage or not, and the implied right of the
community to have his best service as a well-educated
member of society. The effects upon crime and
criminality of the neglect of the education of the
young have been so thoroughly discussed of late as
to require no restatement here.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Better schoolhouses and equipment</span></h4>

<p>A survey of the entire country from one side to
another reveals a deplorable state of affairs in respect
to the conditions of the typical rural schoolhouse.
In thousands of cases, there is nothing more than a
dingy, little, old one-room building, scarcely suitable
as a place wherein to shelter chickens or pigs, and
with nothing in the surroundings to suggest or even
hint at a place where young minds are taught how to
aim at the high things of life. Now, these crude
structures were once a necessity. In pioneer days
the little, old box schoolhouse, or even the sod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
structure, served a mighty purpose in the transformation
of the plains and the wilderness. But times are
now radically changed. The wealth of the country
is abundant. Improvements of nearly every other
sort have gone on as the times advanced. But too
often the little, old cheap schoolhouse on the bleak
country slope became a fixed habit. In setting
forth plans for a newer and better country school
building, the author cannot improve upon those
prepared by E. T. Fairchild, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction in Kansas, and published in his
Seventeenth Biennial Report. We therefore quote
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Location.</i>&mdash;&#8220;In selecting a site for a school
building, the questions of drainage, convenience,
beauty of surroundings, and accessibility should
have prime consideration. Select, if possible, some
plat of ground slightly elevated, and of which the
surface may be properly drained and kept free from
mud. It should be especially seen to that water
may not stand under the building. If the elevation
is not sufficient, this trouble should be overcome by
proper filling in beneath the building. The location
should be as nearly as possible central with reference
to the pupils of the district. But other things
should also be considered. It is better that some
pupils should be put to a slight disadvantage than
that attractiveness of surroundings, remoteness
from environment likely to interfere with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
work of the school, or other essentials, should be
sacrificed.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13.&mdash;This model country school building, planned by State
Superintendent E. T. Fairchild, of Kansas, is being copied in
many places.</span>
</div>

<p>2. <i>The water supply.</i>&mdash;The purity of the water
supply for the school is no less important from the
standpoint of health than that of the air supply.
The greatest danger lies in the use of water taken from
wells that are used only a portion of the year. Such
water is certain to become stagnant. In the autumn
before the term commences special care should be
taken to pump all water out of the well and to clean
the same if necessary; thereby much sickness may
be avoided. The well, of course, should be so located
as to avoid any contamination owing to vaults
or drains.</p>

<p>3. <i>Size and adaptation of grounds.</i>&mdash;The school
grounds should contain at least three acres, and five
acres would not be too much. While the cities are
cramped for playgrounds and purchase them only at
a high cost, the latter can be secured in the country
in sufficient size and at a relatively small expense.
Let it be kept constantly in mind that the school
grounds should be adapted for play, that they should
afford a protection from winds, and that they should
also be attractive. They should likewise be adapted
for school gardening and experiments in agriculture.
For the purpose of play, the breadth should exceed
the depth where there are separate grounds for boys
and girls. Where the playground is large, the building
should be centrally located with relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
size of the grounds and should be situated well toward
the front. This will provide two fair-sized and well-proportioned
playgrounds. Where the grounds are
small and contain but one acre, symmetry must yield
to utility and the building should be located well
to the front and to one side, so as to leave one well-arranged
playground.</p>

<p>4. <i>Improvement of school grounds.</i>&mdash;In writing
of the value of well-arranged school grounds, Professor
Albert Dickens of the Kansas State Agricultural
College says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This sermon on school ground improvement is
one that I have tried to preach for some time. In
my judgment, it is the most important and the most
difficult of any of the problems in civic improvement.
The average country cemetery is sorrowfully neglected,
as a rule, but its treatment is careful and generous
compared with the school grounds of the average
country district. Some day we shall realize that all
these factors of environment are formative influences,
and shall not wonder that the character formed in
surroundings devoid of beauty has hard, coarse, and
cruel lines in its make-up.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an easy matter to picture an ideal country
school&mdash;its clean-swept walk to the road, its ample
playground, its windbreak of evergreens, its groups
of hard- and soft-wood species, borders of shrubs and
beds of bulbs for early spring and perennials for
summer and fall. But to get it&mdash;to find some way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
overcome the serious obstacles&mdash;is worthy the attention
of statesmen and club women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly every district has made an attempt.
That is one of the hard things to forget&mdash;one of the
reasons so many districts fear to try again. They
had a spasm of civic righteousness&mdash;an Arbor Day
revival&mdash;and every patron dug a hole in the hard,
dry ground; every child brought a tree, some of
which were carried for miles with the roots exposed
to sun and wind&mdash;and then they were planted and,
in some cases, watered for the summer; and the
days grew warm and the weeds grew high; and by
the next fall the two or three trees yet alive were not
noticed when the director went over with his mower
the Friday before school opened; and so ended that
attempt at a schoolyard beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to be possible to convince the patrons of
every district that a single acre of land is not sufficient
ground upon which to grow big, bright, broad-minded
boys and girls; that two, or three, or four
acres of land, well planned as to baseball diamond,
basketball court and a good free run for dare-base and
pull-away&mdash;that such would give the state and the
world better results than if the land were devoted to
corn and alfalfa. This, I believe, is the first problem
of great magnitude&mdash;to get the ground&mdash;and it
must be considered. Children must play. The noon
hour, when they eat for five minutes and play
fifty-five minutes, is all-important in a child&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>In order to carry out the suggestions given by
Professor Dickens, why not organize a general rally,
perhaps on the occasion of Arbor Day, and all hands
join in preparing and planting the school grounds to
suitable shade trees, shrubs, and the like? The playgrounds
could also be laid out and equipped on this
occasion. Then, after this excellent start has been
made, have the school board appoint some reliable
man as caretaker of the grounds with payment of
reasonable wages for what he does. Thus the good
beginning will not be lost.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A model rural school</span></h4>

<p>The State Normal School at Kirksville, Missouri,
has built and equipped a model rural school for use in
practical demonstration work. President John R.
Kirk gives a detailed description of this building in
<i>Successful Farming</i> (April, 1911) as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This schoolhouse has three principal floors. The
basement and main floor are the same size, 28 &times; 36
feet, outside measurement. The basement measures
8 feet from floor to ceiling. Its floor is of concrete,
underlaid with porous tile and cinders. The basement
walls are of rock and concrete, protected by
drain tile on outside. The basement has eight compartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;1. Furnace room, containing furnace inclosed by
galvanized iron, also double cold air duct with electric
fan, also gas water heater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>&#8220;2. Coal bin, 6 &times; 8 feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. Bulb or plant room, 3 &times; 8 feet, for fall, winter,
and spring storage.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Darkroom, 4 &times; 8 feet, for children&#8217;s experiments
in photography.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. Laundry room, 5 &times; 21 feet, with tubs, drain, and
drying apparatus.</p>

<p>&#8220;6. Gymnasium or play room, 13 &times; 23 feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;7. Tank room containing a 400-gallon pneumatic
pressure tank, storage battery for electricity, hand
pump for emergencies, water gauge, sewer pipes,
floor drain, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;8. Engine room, containing gasoline engine, water
pump, electrical generator, switchboard, water tank
for cooling gasoline engine, weight for gas pressure,
gas mixer, batteries, pipes, wires, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pumps lift water from a well into pressure
tank through pipes below the frost line. Gasoline is
admitted through pipes below the frost line from two
50-gallon tanks underground, 30 feet from building.
All rooms are wired for electricity and plumbed for
gas. The basement is thoroughly ventilated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The main floor contains a school room 22 &times; 27 feet
in the clear, lighted wholly from the north side. A
ground glass in the rear admits sunlight for sanitation.
Schoolroom has adjustable seats and desks,
telephone, and teachers&#8217; desk. Stereopticon is hung
in wall at rear. Alcove or closet on east side for
books, teachers&#8217; wraps, etc. Schoolroom has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
small organ, ample book cases, shelves, and apparatus.
Pure air enters from above children&#8217;s heads
and passes out at floor into ventilating stack through
fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Main floor has two toilet rooms, each of these
having lavatories, wash bowl with hot and cold water,
pressure tank for hot water and for heat, shower
bath with hot and cold water, ventilating apparatus,
looking glass, towel rack, soap box, etc. Each
toilet room is reached by a circuitous passageway
furnishing room for children&#8217;s wraps, overshoes,
etc. The scheme secures absolute privacy in toilet
rooms. All toilet room walls contain air chambers
to deaden sound. The toilet rooms are clean, decent,
and beautiful. They are never disfigured with vile
language or other defacement.</p>

<p>&#8220;All rural schoolhouses with the comb of the
roof running one way have attics, but the attic of this
rural school is the first one and the only one that has
been well utilized. This attic is 15 &times; 35 feet, inside
measurement, all in one room; distance from floor
to ceiling 7&#189; feet in the middle part. It is abundantly
lighted through gable lights and roof lights.
It contains modern manual-training benches for use
of eight or ten children at one time, a gas range and
other apparatus for experimental cooking. It is
furnished with both gas and electric light. It has a
wash bowl with hot and cold water, looking glass,
towels, etc. It has a large typical kitchen sink and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>drinking fountain, but no drinking cup, either common
or uncommon. It has cupboards, boxes, and receptacles
for various experiments in home economics.
It has a disinfecting apparatus, a portable agricultural-chemistry
laboratory and numerous other equipments.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;A rural school can be built here from beginning to
completion with all the above-mentioned equipments
of every kind, including furniture, for $2250. The
heating and ventilating apparatus, the pressure
tanks, gasoline engine, water pumps, dynamo, furnace,
etc., can all be easily adapted to a two-room
model, a three-room school, or a six-room school by
having each fixture slightly larger.</p>

<p>&#8220;This model therefore solves the schoolbuilding
question for villages, towns, and consolidated rural
schools.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Cornell schoolhouse</span></h4>

<p>An attractive rural schoolhouse was erected some
years ago at the New York State College of Agriculture,
to serve as a suggestion architecturally and
otherwise to rural districts. It is a one-teacher building,
and yet allows for the introduction of the new
methods of teaching. It is a wooden building, with
cement stucco interior, heated with hot-air furnace,
and with two water toilets attached. The total cost
was about $2000. The College writes as follows of
the house:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&#8220;The prevailing rural schoolhouse is a building in
which pupils sit to study books. It ought to be a
room in which pupils do personal work with both
hands and mind. The essential feature of this new
schoolhouse, therefore, is a workroom. This room
occupies one-third of the floor space. Perhaps it
would be better if it occupied two-thirds of the floor
space. If the building is large enough, however, the
two kinds of work could change places in this schoolhouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;The building is designed for twenty-five pupils
in the main room. The folding doors and windows
in the partition enable one teacher to manage both
rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been the purpose to make the main part
of the building about the size of the average rural
schoolhouse, and then to add the workroom as a
wing or projection. Such a room could be added to
existing school buildings; or, in districts in which
the building is now too large, one part of the room
could be partitioned off as a workroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the purpose, also, to make this building
artistic, attractive, and homelike to children, sanitary,
comfortable, and durable. The cement-plaster
exterior is handsomer and warmer than wood, and
on expanded metal lath it is durable. The interior
of this building is very attractive. Nearly any rural
schoolhouse can secure a water-supply and instal
toilets as part of the school building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>&#8220;The openings between schoolroom and workroom
are fitted with glazed swing sash and folding doors,
so that the rooms may be used either singly or
together, as desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The workroom has a bay-window facing south
and filled with shelves for plants. Slate blackboards
of standard school heights fill the spaces about the
rooms between doors and windows. The building is
heated by hot air; vent flues of adequate sizes are
also provided so that the rooms are ventilated.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the front of the building, and adding materially
to its picturesque appearance, is a roomy
veranda with simple square posts, from which
entrance is made directly into the combined vestibule
and coatroom and from this again by two doors
into the schoolroom.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Help make a school play ground</span></h4>

<p>Throughout the entire country there is at last rising
a wave of enthusiasm in behalf of affording the
child a better means of play. First the cities took
the matter up, then the towns, and now the country
districts are beginning to do their part. The farmer
and his wife should feel an interest in such a matter,
for they can render no better service to their community
than that of joining the district teacher in an
effort to equip the school grounds with play apparatus.
As a suggestive outline of what materials to procure,
the dimensions and cost of the same, there is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
below the equipment worked out by certain officials
in Colorado and described briefly in Superintendent
Fairchild&#8217;s report, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A turning pole for boys may be made by setting
two posts in the ground, six or eight feet apart, and
running a 1 or 1&#188; inch gas pipe through holes bored
in the tops of the posts. The cost of such a piece of
apparatus should be as follows, assuming that the
necessary work will be done by the teachers and boys:
Two posts, 4&#8243; &times; 4&#8243;, 8 ft. long, 50 cents; one piece
gas pipe, 8 ft. long, 15 cents.</p>

<p>Teeter boards may be made by planting posts ten
or twelve feet apart, and placing a pole or a rounded
6 &times; 6 on top of them, and then placing boards, upon
which the children may teeter. Individual teeter
boards may be made by placing a 2 &times; 8 board in the
ground, and fastening the teeter board to it by means
of iron braces placed on each side of the upright piece.
The cost of the above apparatus would be, for several
teeters: Two upright posts, 6&#8243; &times; 6&#8243;, 5 ft. long, 93
cents; one piece, 6&#8243; &times; 6&#8243;, 12 ft. long, $1.22; four
teeter boards, 2&#8243; &times; 8&#8243;, 14 ft. long, $2.50. For individual
teeter: One piece 2&#8243; &times; 8&#8243;, 16 ft. long, 56
cents&mdash;to make upright piece 4 ft. long and teeter
board 12 ft. long; two iron braces and four large
screws, 25 cents.</p>

<p>A very attractive and desirable piece of apparatus
may be made as follows: Secure a pole about ten or
fifteen feet long. To the small end attach by the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
bolts one end of a wagon axle, spindle up. Upon the
spindle place a wagon wheel, and to the wheel attach
ropes, about as long as the pole. Place the big end
of the pole in the ground three or four feet, and brace
it from the four points of the compass. The ropes
will hang down from the wheel in such a way that the
children may take hold of them, swing, jump, and
run around the pole. The one described was rather
inexpensive. A telephone company donated a discarded
pole, a farmer a discarded wagon wheel and
axle. The only expense was that of paying a blacksmith
for attaching the wheel to the pole and the
cost of the ropes&mdash;about $2. It furnished one of
the most attractive pieces of apparatus on the playground.</p>

<p>An inexpensive swing may be constructed by placing
four 4 &times; 4&#8217;s in the ground in a slanting position,
two being opposite each other and meeting at the top
in such a way as to form a fork. The pairs may be
ten or twelve feet apart, and a pole or heavy galvanized
pipe, to which swings may be attached,
wired, nailed, or bolted to the crotches formed by the
pieces placed in the ground. The cost of this apparatus
will be: Four pieces, 4&#8243; &times; 4&#8243;, 14 ft. long,
$1.25, one piece galvanized pipe, 3&#8243;, 12 ft. long, $2.50.</p>

<p>Boards of education could well afford to purchase
one or more basketballs, and a few baseballs and bats
for the boys. These things more than pay for themselves
in the added interest which boys and girls who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
have them take in the school. For much of the
apparatus suggested above the wide-awake board of
education and teacher will see opportunities to use
material less expensive than that suggested. And
to such persons many pieces of apparatus not specified
here will suggest themselves to fit particular needs
and opportunities.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">General instruction in agriculture</span></h4>

<p>A great fault with the district schools has been an
inclination to think that anything close at hand is
too mean and common to be considered as subject
matter for instruction. The thought has usually
been that the school would prepare the learner for
some brilliant calling away off where things are
better and life is easier and more beautiful. As a
result, the country schools have been educating boys
and girls away from the farm. The new method is
that of educating them to appreciate what is under
their feet and all around them, through an intimate
knowledge of the processes of nature and industry
as carried on in their midst.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XIV.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_16" name="Fig_16"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;Using the Babcock milk-tester in a New York school.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the more direct means of educating the
boys and girls for a happy, contented life on the
farm is to teach them while young the rudiments of
agriculture. This method is now actually being put
into practice in thousands of the rural schools. The
state of Kansas recently enacted a law requiring all
candidates for teachers&#8217; certificates to pass a test in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>the elements of agriculture and also requiring that
the rudiments of this subject be taught in every district
school. Other states have similar laws. As a
result of this and like provisions, there is now a tremendous
awakening in the direction named. The
boys and girls in the country schools are finding
new meaning and a new interest in the fields and
farms upon which they are growing up.</p>

<p>It is a comparatively simple matter, that of
teaching the young how the plant germinates and
grows, how the seed is produced, and how farm crops
are cared for and harvested. Likewise, it is easy to
describe the elements of the various types of soil and
to show how these elements contribute to the life
and growth of the plant. The questions of moisture
in its relation to plant life, of insects harmful and
helpful to growing crops and animals, of the bird life
as related in its economic aspects to farming&mdash;all
such matters can be easily taught to children by the
young-woman school teacher. It is only necessary
for the latter to take an elementary course of instruction
herself, to read a number of collateral texts,
and to get into the spirit of the undertaking. In a
similar manner, instruction in regard to farm animals
may be given, the emphasis being placed upon the
consideration of the types of live stock actually raised
and marketed in the home neighborhood.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that these matters relating
to elementary agriculture and animal husbandry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
can be made just as interesting and quite as cultural
as any of the subjects in the general curriculum of the
schools. Wherefore, the rural dweller who catches
the spirit of such instruction should lead out in the
securing of public measures and public improvements
looking toward an early embodiment of these
new subjects within the prescribed course of study.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Domestic economy and home sanitation</span></h4>

<p>The time is now at hand when the district school
failing to give any attention to practical household
affairs is to be classed as out of date and unprogressive.
Well-written texts and pamphlets covering the home-keeping
subjects are now both available and cheap,
so that the excuse for deferring their use is approaching
the zero point.</p>

<p>Of course it is impracticable as yet to have apparatus
for cooking and sewing installed in the one-teacher
district school, but the bare rudiments of
these subjects may nevertheless be taught with the
expectation that home practice may be thereby
improved and better understood. Perhaps the
most practical method of present procedure is that
of organizing an independent class of the girls of
suitable age and meeting them informally. The
texts and pamphlets furnished by the college extension
departments may be followed. In case of
graded and high school courses this work should by all
means be carried on as a regular class exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Home sanitation may easily and profitably be
taught in the district school, even though only one
or two periods per week be set apart for the purpose.
Perhaps the best method of instruction is that of
presenting carefully one specific lesson at a time.
For example, pure drinking water, clean milk, food
contamination by house flies may be treated each
in its turn. Adequate charts and illustrations should
be brought into service.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Consolidation of rural schools</span></h4>

<p>There is much agitation nowadays in regard to
consolidating the rural schools. Although present
progress is slow, it seems comparatively certain that
the one-teacher rural school is destined in time to become
a thing of the past. However, there is no particular
haste in the matter, provided some such plans
as the foregoing be put into effect in case of the
single school. Perhaps the sparsely settled district
has the greatest justification for looking toward consolidation.
It happens that there are thousands of
small schools having an attendance of from five to
ten pupils. In such an instance, it is practically impossible
to do the best work, the children lacking the
spur of rivalry and enthusiasm and the helpful lessons
in social ethics offered only by the larger massing
of the young at play.</p>

<p>In many places, three or four rural districts are
uniting in this movement, the general plan being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that of constructing a central building with ample
working space for all, and then transporting the
children to and from the school. The scheme is
working well as a rule. Among the great advantages
is that of a possible grading of the school so that
the teacher may have time for each subject and more
opportunity for specialization. Perhaps the most
serious and difficult part of the plan is that of providing
a safe and suitable means of conveyance to and
from the school. Some excellent patterns of school
wagons are already on the market, while manufacturers
are constantly at work improving them. So
we may expect better results as time goes on. It
has already been shown very satisfactorily that the
conveyance, when in charge of a well-trained driver,
furnishes improved moral and physical safeguards for
the child.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">More high schools needed</span></h4>

<p>Not only every county, but also every rural
township, should have its well-equipped high school.
It is a serious matter to send boys and girls in their
middle teens away to college. Many lives are thus
more or less ruined simply from too early loss of
the personal restraints and influence of the parents.
But with a first-class high school in easy reach
the young people may at least return home for the
Saturday-Sunday recess and thereby continue in the
close councils of their parents. And then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
rightly-managed high school will bring the student
into closer touch with the local rural problems that
may not be possible in case of the distant institution.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XV.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<a id="Fig_17" name="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xv.png" width="383" height="500" alt="" title="Plate XV" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 17-21.&mdash;This magnificent consolidated school in Winnebago
County, Illinois, was inspired by the excellent work of the well-known
Superintendent O. J. Kern. The four little one-room
buildings illustrated above gave way to it.</span>
</div>

<p>In the location of high schools intended to serve the
rural interests there should be an effort to keep away
from the towns and cities. In the latter places the
allurements of the cheap theater and the snobbery
that often invades the city high school are illustrations
of the evils that serve to entice the young away
from the substantial things of life. A good county
or township high school located centrally and in
the open country is ideal. At such a location it is
vastly easier than in the city to center the attention
of the students upon the rural problems, not to
mention the greater availability of demonstrations
on farm and garden plots.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Better rural teachers needed</span></h4>

<p>The ideal preparation for a teacher in the rural
school is a complete course in a first-class agricultural
college, with the inclusion of a few terms&#8217; work in
the educational subjects. So long as we send into
the district schools young teachers who have been
taught merely in the common text-book branches,
and whose training has been exclusively pedagogical,
the practice of educating the boys and girls away from
the farm will go on. The country school is, in its best
sense, an industrial school; and only those teachers
can do best work therein who have had the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
experience in industrial training and the changed
point of view which only the agricultural college
can give. So if the board of trustees in any rural
district really wishes to unite in supporting an effective
back-to-the-farm movement, let them offer to
some country-reared graduate of the agricultural
college a salary of about twice or three times the
amount usually paid. After a few terms of school
taught by such a person, the good effects on the
rural uplift will most certainly reveal themselves.
But so long as school trustees continue to try to
drive a sharp bargain in the employment of teachers&mdash;securing
the one with the passable county certificate
who will teach for the least wages&mdash;the
boys will continue to run off to town for &#8220;jobs&#8221;
and the parents will continue to &#8220;move to town to
educate their children.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is some hope of a new ideal in relation to
the country school teacher; namely, that he shall
be a man in every sense, worthy of a salary large
enough to support himself and his family the year
round as residents of the community. Then we
shall have a profession of teaching in the rural
school work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
<br />
<i>THE COUNTY YOUNG MEN&#8217;S CHRISTIAN
ASSOCIATION</i></h3>


<p>Among the movements of first importance looking
toward the uplift of young men is that named at the
head of this chapter. Parallel with the intensive
and systematic effort to build up the commercial
life of the city and allow the country district to
take care of itself, has been a like effort to provide for
the care and development of the city boy and the
uniform neglect of the needs and interests of the
country boy. Now, here at last is a movement
that is proving a real means of salvation of the rural
youth, mind, body, and soul.</p>

<p>President Henry J. Waters, of the Kansas State
Agricultural College, struck the keynote of this
young country-life movement most effectively in a
recent address when he said: &#8220;We believe in the
existence of a social renaissance. One needs only
to read the daily and weekly papers printed in
hundreds of prosperous villages and cross roads
corners, the faithful chroniclers of the community&#8217;s
activities, to find buoyant hope of the future of
farm life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>&#8220;The dignity of labor; the close connection
between heads and hands; the monthly or weekly
meetings of farmers&#8217; institutes in hundreds of
counties; the special lectures provided by agricultural
colleges; the movable schools; the farmers&#8217;
winter short courses, in which thousands of men and
women and boys and girls participate; corn contests;
bread contests; sewing contests; play carnivals;
poultry-raising contests; stock-raising contests; conferences
on the country church, country school, good
roads&mdash;all these activities denote the growth of a
new and mighty spirit in the country life of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need further demonstrations, together with
concrete thinking, a lot of constructive programs,
and a deal of hard work and self-sacrifice, in which
the county work department of the Young Men&#8217;s
Christian Association can have no little share, to
speed on the great epoch of rural social renaissance.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Boys leave the farm too young</span></h4>

<p>It is a tragic story when the whole truth is known,
that of the young boy running off to town in search of
some employment that will bring him a little ready
cash for spending money, and also in search of the
sociability so woefully lacking in the rural home
environment. Too long have the country parents
attempted to argue and scold and force their boys
to remain at home where they are confronted only
with the monotony of hard work and a very dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
prospect of a possible land or other property inheritance.
So at last there is being raised the very important
questions, What is the matter with the
country boy? and What can be done to help him?
Knowledge of the fact that more than one-half of
the boys of the United States are living in farm
homes makes the problem of their individual salvation
assume momentous proportions.</p>

<p>There can be no reasonable thought of holding
all the boys on the farm. Many of them are best
fitted by nature to go elsewhere and find suitable
employment, but there is every good reason for
preventing the great exodus of immature youths
who run off to the cities, not knowing what they are
to face and without any well-defined purpose. Yes,
the great concerns of the towns and cities must continue
to call many of the brainiest young men from
the rural districts. In fact, the country may with
every good reason be considered the proper breeding
ground for the virile minds destined to control the
great affairs of nation, state, and municipality.
But every reasonable effort must be put forth to
keep the boy in his country home until his character
is relatively matured and his plans for a future
career are fairly well defined.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Purposes of the County Y.M.C.A.</span></h4>

<p>Doubtless the first chief purpose of the county
association is that of building up the boy&#8217;s character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and finally perfecting his spiritual nature. But this
high aim is not sought in the old-fashioned, direct
manner. Instead, there is a studied effort to build
up the boy gradually through the enlistment of
his natural interests in matters that lie dormant in
his home environment. The truly scientific method
in this field is first concerned with providing means
whereby the boy may work out his own spiritual
salvation. Along with the farm labors, tedious and
irksome to him when undertaken as exclusive requirements,
the country boy is given an opportunity
to take part in certain athletic and social exercises
which appeal to his instincts and arouse the spontaneity
from the depths of his own nature.</p>

<p>In carrying on the country work, an attempt is
made to approach the boy from the peculiar situations
of his home environment. What specific readjustments
are needed in his home life in respect to the
amount of work required of him? What of the recreation
he enjoys? The local society in which he
moves? The home church and Sunday school?
The temptations that may lie near about him? and so
on. These and many other such inquiries are made
with a view to dealing with the boy in an individual
way and re&#235;stablishing his life for the better.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How to organize a county association</span></h4>

<p>Unless it may chance that, after a brief survey of
the field, some person from the outside comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to perfect the organization of the county association,
any interested person within the limits of the county
must make the start. Devotion to the cause,
persistence, and unfailing enthusiasm are perhaps
the best personal equipment for the local beginner
of this new work. His first concern should be that
of gathering a committee of men like himself from
different parts of the county. Doubtless these will
form themselves into a sort of brotherhood committee.
After such temporary organization, the next
important step is that of securing an able county
leader.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XVII.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_23" name="Fig_23"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xvii.png" width="500" height="349" alt="" title="Plate XVII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 23.&mdash;These Y.M.C.A. members find time for play as well as work. Try a club like this
as a means of keeping the boy interested in the farm.</span>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Choose a good leader.</i>&mdash;Now, the success of
the movement is to depend very largely upon the
character of the leader to be chosen. If the right
man be selected, no matter how hard the conditions,
he will be able finally to bring system and
order and spiritual progress out of it all. The
important characteristics of the ideal leader of
country boys are comparatively few. First of all,
he must, of course, be moved by a sense of devotion
to the cause of Christianity&mdash;the up-building
of the characters, especially the spiritual natures,
of young men. He should be a man who has been
trained in a good college, if possible a graduate, with
experience in the Y.M.C.A. and other like organizations.
He should have had some special
training in such subjects as psychology, sociology,
and economics, and should be fairly well versed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the literature of these subjects. He should be especially
fond of boys and boy life and interested in
the conduct of people of every kind and sort. He
should be somewhat trained in athletics and an enthusiastic
supporter of clean sports. He should
have what is known as good business sense. It
may not be essential, but it will certainly prove
advantageous, if the chosen leader has himself
been reared in the country.</p>

<p>2. <i>Local leaders necessary.</i>&mdash;After the leader has
been selected, the next step is that of the appointment
of carefully chosen leaders for the local neighborhoods.
These may be men of almost any age from
middle life down, but perhaps the ideal age would be
that of a few years older than any of the boys of
the neighborhood. All must be enlisted if possible,
not one being slighted or offended.</p>

<p>3. <i>A committee on finance.</i>&mdash;An able finance
committee is also of high importance. This should
consist of men chosen especially for their unusual
ability as solicitors and persuaders of men in a
financial way. Let these workers go over the county
soliciting funds for the organization, providing
from the first especially that the secretary shall be
well paid for his services. Close-fisted residents, as
well as all others, in every nook and corner of the
territory must be seen and asked to contribute. It
should be a comparatively easy matter to show men
who cannot appreciate the social and spiritual needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
of the boys that the new movement will most certainly
increase general property values and bring
up the price of land.</p>

<p>4. <i>Little property ownership.</i>&mdash;While new, the
county organization should guard against attempting
to own and control any considerable amount of
property or equipment. Not the material goods
possessed, but the strength and force of the spiritual
enthusiasm will have greatest value in carrying on
the work. It will be found quite satisfactory in
nearly every case to have the boys meet in some
farm home, village club room, or country schoolhouse.
And then, there is always danger of developing
a Y.M.C.A. too exclusively as a business organization.
There are many instances in the towns
and cities where this is deplorably true. The best
spirit of the work is submerged by the continuous
hounding of the people in the skirmish for funds to
keep going the over-heavy business machinery of
the institution. There often develops, in such
cases, a large body of men who regard the Y.M.C.A.
as an organization of loafers and easy-going money
spenders. Once such sentiment develops, it is desperately
difficult to eradicate it. So the country
Y.M.C.A. should preserve the semblance of humility,
and that partly by getting along with almost no property
or equipment other than what its own members
may provide in a crude fashion and what may be
necessary to furnish the office of the general secretary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How to conduct the work</span></h4>

<p>One of the first steps in conducting the new work
is that of making a survey of the entire county.
The names, ages, and location of all the boys must
be secured, together with some items respecting
their present social and religious affiliations. In
fact, the more personal items included in the first
survey, the better. Some boys will at first look
with disfavor upon the new movement, believing
that it is merely another scheme to convert them
to religion and get them into a church. Care must
be taken to disabuse the boy&#8217;s mind of this thought
from the very beginning. Therefore, it may be well
not to try to hustle him into a Bible-study class the
first time he is invited out. While the main issue,
namely, that of spiritual development of the boy,
is not to be forgotten, he must nevertheless be led
to this goal through the path of many very common
instrumentalities. A Y.M.C.A. athletic meet would
most probably prove a better opening number than
a Bible-study class or merely a religious service. As
the work proceeds, the occasions for a great variety
of exercises and programs will present themselves.
Among these perhaps there would be the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Local and county athletic clubs.</i>&mdash;The athletic
event is one of the easiest to put on in a newly
organized boys&#8217; club. An able leader, perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
county secretary, should be present to preside over
the event, inducing the boys to form a baseball
club, or a basketball team; or at least to arrange
for some event in which they can all participate,
although that may be as simple a thing as swimming
or jumping. Introduce at once the thought of
practice and the development of skill, holding out
the plan of a county organization and a county
field meet in the future, which all may attend and
in which the ablest shall have promise of a conspicuous
part.</p>

<p>2. <i>Debating and literary clubs.</i>&mdash;There is always
the possibility of a literary society, provided the thing
be carefully instituted. The secret of successful
debates among persons of any class is to find a
&#8220;burning&#8221; question. So, avoid such matters as
Tariff Reform and the World Peace Movement
and come right down home to some perplexing
problem in the lives of the boys of the club. Something
about their work, their lack of recreation,
their chances against those of city boys, and so on,
will arouse interest and bring out rough debating
material. Find latent talent of other sorts in the
club. Some boy can sing; perhaps another can play
a musical instrument; still another one may be a
natural-born storyteller; a fourth may be an expert
acrobat and tree climber; a fifth a shrewd hunter or
trapper of wild animals. In this way, nearly every
boy can be led to take part in a general program.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Thus, while contributing something toward the
entertainment of all, each boy&#8217;s active participation
will go far by way of awakening his personal interest
in the new life.</p>

<p>3. <i>Receptions and suppers.</i>&mdash;After the boys get
fairly under way with their club, they may need
to arrange an oyster supper or some such affair
at which they will discuss their many mutual problems.
On some such occasions they may desire
to invite their parents to come and enjoy the program,
also to participate in the discussion of their affairs.
This form of close association will be found especially
enticing to the boys, giving them a good, clean
place to go for social enjoyment and something
to look forward to in their thoughts during the somewhat
prosaic hours of the day in the field.</p>

<p>4. <i>Educational tours and problems.</i>&mdash;The boys
may find it feasible to go in a body once or twice a
year on an educational tour&mdash;to the state fair; to
study some particular thing in the city; to gather
data for the solution of some local problem; to
make a study of the habitat of some bird or animal;
to gather specimens of rocks or plants; and
so on. In case of any such trip there is not a little
necessity of some college-trained person as overseer,
so that the study may be made intensive and not
become dissipated in mere sport and fun. It is
usually advisable to make a careful study of only
one thing at a time.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XVIII.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_24" name="Fig_24"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xviii.png" width="500" height="313" alt="" title="Plate XVIII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 24&mdash;A great Y.M.C.A. Convention in Ohio. Let the boy attend one of these great gatherings if
possible, and he will return with a year&#8217;s supply of enthusiasm.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>5. <i>Camping and hiking.</i>&mdash;The boys of the county
should be brought together at least once a year in a
summer camp. Farmers will soon learn to appreciate
the value of such things in the life of the boy and will
gladly allow him a few days&#8217; vacation for the purpose.
The boy who enjoys such a privilege will more than
pay it back through the extra amount of work his
enthusiasm will naturally prompt him to perform.
For the camp site there should be selected some
shady woodland with a good stream of water for
fishing and swimming. A crude lodge may be constructed
and all the necessary crude camp equipment
provided. Each boy will want to carry his own
blanket and extra clothing.</p>

<p>One matter must be considered in all seriousness;
namely, the sanitation of the camp. Even at the
outlay of a comparatively heavy expense, the camp
food supplies, including the dining table, should be
screened off from flies. The garbage therefore will
all be scrupulously buried, and it will be ascertained
with certainty that the drinking water is free from
disease organisms. Then, the boys may sleep on
the ground, wallow in the dirt, splash in the water
and mud as they please and return home in the
best of health.</p>

<p>6. <i>Exhibitions.</i>&mdash;It has been found practicable
to have the boys prepare during the season for
coming together with a county exhibit, including
a wide variety of things peculiar to their interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>This exhibition should be made as a big annual
event, if possible, such as will attract all manner
of persons and make friends for the county association.
In its ideal arrangement the money expense
will be kept down to a minimum. Also keep out
the idea of premiums. The contest plan of promotion
will some day receive its desired consideration
and lose its place as a means of promoting
social and spiritual well-being. As a matter of
fact it fosters much envy, ill-feeling, and bitter strife
and thus strikes at the root of the good-fellowship
which you are striving to encourage. <i>But, urge
every boy to bring something for the sake of the help
he may contribute and let the honor of this service
and the approbation of his fellows be his high reward.</i></p>

<p>One boy may come with a mammoth pumpkin;
another with a device of his own invention for catching
ground squirrels; still another with a new
method of tying a knot; another with a bushel
of highly bred corn; others with farm and garden
produce of the same attractive nature; others with
wild grasses, curios, or geological specimens; others
with the parts of a miniature menagerie. One
boy may have caught a badger alive; another
a coyote; another a jack rabbit; another a huge
turtle. Another may bring a cage of rattlesnakes
or a box full of snakes of all sorts; another a set of
original plans and specifications&mdash;for an ideal
farmhouse, or farm barn and surroundings; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
making the well sanitary; for a milk house; for
keeping flies out of the house or barn; a recipe
for driving ants and other insects from the house.
The boys in one family may come with a lot of
samples of soil, showing how differently each must
be treated for the same general crop results. Others
may bring specimens of &#8220;cheat&#8221; and noxious weeds,
and the like, with a scheme for destroying them.
Another may have a plan for a patent churn or a
labor-saving device in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Thus there may be brought to the boys&#8217; fair an
interesting and most instructive variety of objects,
plans, and devices, all looking toward the improvement
of home conditions. Such a gathering as this
will bring not only the parents and other adults from
the home county, but great flocks of outsiders
will also come in and learn and become deeply
interested in the affairs of the County Young Men&#8217;s
Christian Association.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Spirituality not lost sight of</span></h4>

<p>It ought to be easy for the average thinker to
appreciate the fact that all the foregoing rough-and-ready
work in the lives of the boys can be made a
practical means of the salvation of their souls as well
as of their bodies and intellects. Spiritual perfection
is not reached at a bound. There must be
much doing of the crude yet worthy things which
grow naturally out of his inner nature before the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
can finally achieve a degree of spiritual development
that may prove a permanent and fixed part of his
adult life. Yes, there will be some Bible study, an
occasional short prayer, and now and then a real
sermonette in connection with the work of the organization,
but much more frequently the Christian
life and character will come as a sort of discovery in
the boy&#8217;s life and that through his own conduct.</p>

<p>Through all this wholesome exercise of his better
and cleaner interests, the youth will gradually be
led away and kept away from those things which
contaminate both the body and the spirit and introduce
the individual to a coarse, debauched life. In
other words, Christianity will be a thing achieved and
that through the young man&#8217;s efforts rather than a
thing instantly caught in some emotional revival
meeting only gradually to waste away in the months
immediately following. One well-built specimen of
Christian manhood&mdash;a character of the sort which
the ideal work of the County Y.M.C.A. may finally
construct&mdash;is worth a dozen of those suddenly converted
men whose secret lives are so often embittered
with the consciousness of backsliding and following
ever after the old evil ways.</p>

<p>It will be observed at a glance that in the foregoing
outline there is an avoidance of the heavier work-a-day
tasks and problems. It is the thought of the author
that the boys have quite enough of such labor as it is
and that the County Y.M.C.A. can do its best serv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>ice
if it provides a set of new activities of a more
recreative sort. The central idea&mdash;second to the
perfection of his spiritual nature&mdash;is that of giving
the boy a larger amount of social experience through
self-training in matters that will bring out his latent
unselfishness and his self-reliance. The heavier
problems of an economic sort suitable for discussion
among the boys and the girls of the country districts
will have due consideration in another chapter.</p>

<p>In planning the various parts of the county work
and the club life of the boys, there must be extreme
care not to arrange for too many and too frequent
meetings. It is especially to be desired that the
boy do not acquire the runabout habit, even though
he may in every case go to a desirable place. Therefore,
in arranging the programs it will be seen to that
the meetings are held somewhat infrequently, but
that on each occasion the meeting be continued
until some intensive work has been done. For
example, it would be much preferable to have all or
a major part of one afternoon and evening of the
week for the exercises rather than to have brief
evening meetings a number of times during the week.</p>

achieved during the first year in the Y.M.C.A. of

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
<i>THE FARMER AND HIS WIFE AS LEADERS
OF THE YOUNG</i></h3>


<p>No less urgent and divine is the call for spiritual
aid and leadership in the rural districts to-day than
was that which came to the apostle Paul of old in
form of a vision and a voice crying, &#8220;Come over
into Macedonia and help us.&#8221; In the open country
field, far removed from church or social center, is the
demand for leaders and directors especially great.
Men engage for a lifetime in an enthusiastic endeavor
to amass wealth and to build up great business concerns.
But the man or woman who heeds the call
to go forth into the country districts and save the
bodies and souls of the young&mdash;that person will
not only experience exceeding great joy and enthusiasm
in his work, but he will thereby lay up for himself
in the memories of the redeemed a precious
treasury of golden deeds.</p>

<p>Country parents as a rule are not in a position to do
the best things even for their own children, much
less to go out as leaders of the young at large. They
are sometimes lacking in the necessary means, more
frequently too busy, and most frequently not suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>ciently
informed as to be fully awake to the meanings
and possibilities of any such undertaking. However,
in nearly every country neighborhood there is a man
or woman, or both, who possess many of the big
opportunities for enlisting in the service of the young.
Those who have no small children of their own to
care for would naturally be freest to get away from
the present home duties. Then, some parents having
children of their own not infrequently catch the
inspiration and heed the call. At any rate, it is entirely
fair and reasonable to assume that some one
of the neighborhood could do it were there the disposition.</p>

<p>As a means of arousing any such persons to attempt
to do some constructive work among country boys
and girls, the following detailed suggestions are
offered. Those who feel at all called to undertake
this service may be assured that the interest grows
more intense with time and effort put forth, and that
the joy of accomplishing something in behalf of the
young people of one&#8217;s own vicinity is perhaps unsurpassed
by that of any other type of human endeavor.
In the discussions to follow we assume that some
farmer and his wife have heeded this divine call.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Preparation for the service</span></h4>

<p>Since very few are sufficiently versatile to undertake
any and every kind of social work, perhaps the
first step is that of choosing a definite line of action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
And let the choice be in the direction of the chooser&#8217;s
leading social interest. As a means of preparation
for efficient work a brief course of training is to be
much commended. It may be found practicable to
slip away from home during the winter months and
take a farmers&#8217; short course in one of the agricultural
colleges. Or, one may find the peculiar instruction
and inspiration needed by attending a convention or
conference of the ablest leaders representative of the
work. One of the rural-life conferences now frequently
held might be found ideal. Go prepared to
take notes, to ask questions, and especially to obtain
a large number of literary references.</p>

<p>The use of helpful literature is most important at
this stage. A magazine which admirably covers this
particular field is <i>Rural Manhood</i>, published by the
Association Press, New York City. Then, secure
the report of the Country Life Commission, and a
number of the latest works of a similar nature, some
of which are listed below. Write to the Department
of Agriculture at Washington for their bulletin on
the organization of boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; clubs. Also from
the extension department of the agricultural college
may be obtained for the asking all available literature
of this same general class.</p>

<p>Now, make a careful survey of the neighborhood, or
the larger field, with a view to finding out the specific
conditions in relation to the chosen line of service.
Make lists of names and ages of the boys and girls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
including all other data of a helpful nature. Proceed
with the thought that the work to be undertaken is
not to be merely a means of entertainment, but of
education for the young.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Work persistently for social unity</span></h4>

<p>In his most instructive volume &#8220;The Rural Church
and Community Achievement,&#8221; President Butterfield
says: &#8220;We are in great need in this country of
an institution or institutions which have for their
definite objective the study of the conditions and
problems of farm home-life; not merely the matter
of home management, or home keeping, but the
fundamental relationships of the family to the development
of a better community life in the rural regions.&#8221;
Now, let the newly enlisted social worker assume that
he is to undertake something by way of bringing
about a fuller integration and unity of the people
of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Every new worker in the social field needs a word
of warning against the rebukes and discouragements
with which he may at first meet. To say the best,
the neighborhood will doubtless be indifferent in
regard to the newly proposed organization. But
let the social worker go on persistently, unmindful
of any such hindrance, even though scarcely a person
in the neighborhood seems ready to join in the
movement. In the typical case of valuable constructive
work of this sort, it will be found at first that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
masses are practically all opposed to the plan. However,
as fast as it wins its way through unrelenting
effort and unswerving devotion, the doubters and
opposers will come over to its support. And after
the movement has established itself reasonably well
and achieved something worth while, the same people
who once stood out will then fall enthusiastically
into line and help with the undertaking.</p>

<p>It will be impossible, of course, to point out definitely
to the local, self-appointed leader just what
plan of social endeavor to follow. Since there is
such a great variety of conditions, it seems advisable
here to make a somewhat extended list of possible
lines of work in the rural districts.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Corn-raising and bread-baking clubs</span></h4>

<p>Perhaps among the easiest organizations to effect
among the young people of any farm district are the
clubs or contests in juvenile farm work and home
economics. The beginning of such a purpose will
consist of getting into communication with the extension
department of the state agricultural college.
After obtaining their literature and learning their
methods of procedure, call the boys and girls together,
asking their parents to come along. It may be
found practicable to call a general meeting of the
entire neighborhood, inviting old and young possibly
to a basket dinner, and there to lay before them the
plans of the organizations. While the contest in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>corn-raising or bread-baking has proved a marked
success where tried, if possible arrange matters so
that every earnest endeavor on the part of the young
shall receive a suitable reward, not merely the winners
of the first and second prizes.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XIX.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 308px;">
<a id="Fig_25" name="Fig_25"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xix.png" width="308" height="500" alt="" title="Plate XIX" />
<span class="caption">(Courtesy of American Magazine.)<br />
<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 25.&mdash;Jerry Moore, the champion boy corn raiser of the United
States. He raised 253 bushels on a single acre of ground.</span>
</div>

<p>It is usually an easy matter to secure funds for
paying the way of the boys to the state-wide farmers&#8217;
institute or the boys&#8217; institute usually held at the
agricultural college during the holiday season. Provide
that every boy who reaches a certain standard&mdash;say,
that of raising so many bushels of corn on an acre
of land&mdash;shall go at the expense of the fund.
Likewise, organize the girls into a bread-baking club
or something of the sort. Prizes may be offered for
the best bread, but all the girls whose home-making
work meets a certain fixed standard of requirement
should have promise of a suitable reward. Perhaps
they too may be sent without expense to themselves
to a state conference on home economics. In case
of these trips to the state meetings it will be necessary
to appoint responsible chaperons for the boys
and girls.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other forms of contests</span></h4>

<p>It may be found advisable to start a good-roads
contest among the boys of the home township,
offering an attractive prize to the one who shows the
best results at the end of a given period and a per
diem payment of money to every boy who faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
takes care of his half mile or quarter mile of public
road.</p>

<p>Then, there may be instituted on a small scale stock
shows and poultry shows in the hands of the boys of
the neighborhood. To this the girls too may come
with any such thing as display specimens of their
home sewing and fancy work, house plants, and the
like. In fact, these exhibitions may gradually
develop into a sort of neighborhood or township fair
for the special benefit of the young. To this display
may be brought, not only the items named immediately
above, but the larger variety of things mentioned
in the chapter on the Rural Y.M.C.A.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The improvement of the school situation</span></h4>

<p>Rural leaders will nearly always find many opportunities
for improving the local school situation.
But let the organizer keep unfailingly in view the high
aims of all this rural work; namely, the awakening
of a deeper interest in the affairs that normally belong
to the neighborhood life, and the fuller measure
of joy and contentment to result from every such
achievement. So, there may be undertaken the
redirection of the work of the country school. For
example, bring forces to bear upon it that will result
in the introduction of the study of elementary agriculture
and the simple elements of home keeping
and home sanitation therein. Work for a better
class of teachers and a higher salary payment. En<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>deavor
to have the length of the school term extended
and the school attendance made more regular. Institute
a series of red-letter days for the school during
the year. It may be practicable to have a
&#8220;parents&#8217; day,&#8221; an occasion on which all will be
invited to come out and join the pupils in a noonday
lunch and learn more about the progress and the
needs of the school. Provide a half-day for free and
open discussion of school matters and if possible organize
among the patrons a sort of &#8220;boosters&#8217; club.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another form of endeavor in behalf of the schools
is that of striving for improvement of the high school
facilities of the neighborhood. Perhaps there is not
a high school within riding distance of the homes.
Cannot one be instituted, say, for the township?
Or, what can be done to improve the present neighborhood
relations to the high school that may be
already within reach? Is there a prohibitive tuition
fee? Does the high school now in existence
actually serve through its courses the best interests
of young people who come in from the neighborhood?
Again, perhaps it would be feasible to organize the
grown boys and girls who have dropped out of the
country school into a neighborhood group and provide
a daily conveyance for taking them to and from
the town high school By this means, many may be
induced to go to school who are idling away the valuable
winter months.</p>

<p>During the last decade, what has been the trend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the young men and women who have gone from the
home district to high school or college? Have any
of the best of them returned to the farm? Or, have
these institutions been a means of sending them away
as permanent city dwellers? Does this thing need
to continue? Cannot some movement be instituted
for bringing about a radical change? So long as the
country boys and girls attend the town high schools
and there be required to take the old-fashioned classical
courses&mdash;which have always served to introduce
their minds to the city life and to the professional
callings&mdash;the country districts will continue to be
depleted of their best brains and energy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Home and school play problems</span></h4>

<p>Start a movement in the interest of better provided
play opportunities for the children of the neighborhood.
The possibilities of enriching and extending
the young life through the avenue of better play are
just beginning to be understood. We have always
accepted the theory that young children must have
some time to play, but we have given little or no heed
to the matter of providing for their play such apparatus
as might furnish scientific contributions to the
development of their characters.</p>

<p>Make a brief inquiry throughout the neighborhood
and you will perhaps find that not a single farm home
has apparently given this matter any definite attention.
Now, what playthings may easily be provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in such homes? After having determined that
matter, begin a campaign of education of the rural
parents. First, write to the Playground Association
of America in New York City and ask for a list of
their literature on play. From this source you will
obtain pamphlets and larger volumes giving specific
suggestions for installing rural play apparatus, and
details as to dimensions, prices, and the like. Now,
you are ready for work. Appeal to a centrally located
family for their co&#246;peration in establishing a model.
Induce them to provide for their children a full set
of the apparatus, seeing to it that the expense is kept
down to the minimum. Nearly all of the materials
of construction are lying about the ordinary farm
home and need only to be assembled and put into
place. Once you have established your model home
playground, then invite your neighbors in to see it,
perhaps making a sort of picnic or holiday occasion
out of the affair. At any rate, you may be sure that
the parents of the neighborhood will begin at once
to copy the models and many will even improve upon
them.</p>

<p>Along with your efforts there may be necessary a
campaign of instruction and admonition in relation
to the play of the children. Many parents may be
working their small boys and girls too hard and
allowing not enough time for play. In this respect
your persistent effort will in time show excellent
results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Let us suppose that the farm home selected for the
model playthings has at least one small boy and one
small girl therein. Then, the following might be set
up:&mdash;</p>

<p>A swing, a seesaw, a sliding board or pole, a pair of
rings, a trapeze, and a horizontal bar. Have all
under shade if possible. Provide also a small play
wagon and a cart or two, with a sand box for the
small child.</p>

<p>Inspect the district school in reference to play facilities
and you may find nothing other than the bare
ground with perhaps a baseball diamond. Here,
then, is a rare opportunity for constructive work.
Organize in your own way a boosters&#8217; club and provide
play apparatus. In <a href="#Page_101">Chapter VIII</a> you will find
full details as to the equipment best suited for the
purpose. Provide in every case that the expense be
minimized. Nearly all of the apparatus may be
constructed free of cost by interested persons in the
home neighborhood or in the near-by village.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A neighborhood library</span></h4>

<p>Another very enticing line of endeavor for the rural
leader is that of establishing the country library.
Some one in the neighborhood has a big house, one
room or more of which may conveniently be set
apart for the purpose. Induce the owners of this
house to clear up a room and remodel it, if need be,
and make their home a sort of intellectual center for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the district. Of course the schoolhouse or rural
church may be available for the purpose, but the farm
home will be better for a great many reasons, among
them being the possibility of having the library open
at all hours of the day so that books may be exchanged
on the occasion of one&#8217;s passing the place. Now, go
after the well-to-do residents of the district and gather
a fund for the library. Paint in glowing terms the
visions you have of this thing when it has been set
on foot. Declare your purpose as that of helping
and uplifting the community life. Show the &#8220;close-fisted&#8221;
resident that the establishment of a neighborhood
library will attract desirable settlers into the
district and improve prices of land and produce.</p>

<p>After having obtained a small fund, consult the
best authorities for advice in selecting the books. By
all means avoid cheap stories and trash of every other
sort. Since your work is in behalf of the young,
obtain a few attractive and instructive picture books.
There can probably be obtained a book which treats
and illustrates fully the bird life of the local state,
giving a brief description and pictures in their natural
color. Young people may be very much attracted
by authentic books of the nature-study class,
including those descriptive of wild animals and of
hunting and exploring tales. Consult the lists given
under the chapter on the literature in the country
home for additional titles and suggestions.</p>

<p>If it be found difficult or impracticable to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
books for the neighborhood library, then, the next
best thing will be the traveling library. Communicate
with the state library association and learn
definitely what may be obtained from that source.
Then, proceed to bring the best available volumes
into the neighborhood. In the selection of the library
do not forget the local interest. Secure every attractive
volume that will help to make the boys and
girls acquainted with the best meanings of their own
community life and more interested in staying by the
home affairs and building them up. Not the least
among the valuable elements of the neighborhood
library will be the periodicals, in the selection of
which expert advice is recommended.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Holidays and recreation for the young</span></h4>

<p>In an ably written article published in <i>Rural
Manhood</i> of January, 1910, John R. Boardman,
International County Work Secretary, says: &#8220;A
new gospel of the recreation life needs to be proclaimed
in the country. Rural America must be compelled
to play. It has to a degree toiled itself into deformity,
disease, depravity, and depression. Its long
hours of drudgery, its jealousy of every moment of
daylight, its scorn of leisure and of pleasure must
give way to shorter hours of labor, occasional periods
of complete relaxation and whole-hearted participation
in wholesome plays, festivals, picnics, games,
and other recreative amusements. Better health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
greater satisfaction, and a richer life wait on the wise
development of this recreative ideal.&#8221;</p>

<p>A brief survey of the neighborhood will doubtless
show the lack of general method in dealing with the
farm boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; holidays and vacations during
the long summer months. Here, then, is apparent
another field for constructive leadership. In proceeding
to change the present situation, it may be
well to gather a considerable list of authoritative
statements like the one just quoted. Farm parents
gradually fall into the habit of over-working their
half-grown children. Now, if we can institute a
custom of weekly half holidays for the young people
of the neighborhood, a splendid work will be done
in behalf of a higher community life.</p>

<p>Begin work by selecting an attractive central
location, and plan that the young, and the older ones,
too, may come to this place one afternoon every week,
or at least two afternoons every month, and have a
good time generally. Games may be played, local
clubs may meet in the shade of the trees, the sewing
society and other groups of women having their interests
served. The farmers&#8217; clubs may have opportunity
for helpful exchange of ideas, while the little
children may play and romp about the premises.
Invite all to come early in the afternoon and bring
an evening lunch to be enjoyed in common. Thus,
you may give the young people who regard their
everyday work as drudgery, such interest and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>spiration
as to tone up their lives noticeably for every
hour of the long days of toil.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Many over-work their children</span></h4>

<p>In connection with your efforts in behalf of the
holiday or weekly picnic, take up carefully the matter
of the proper amount of work for the farm boys and
girls of any given age. You will find such willingness
on the part of parents to do the right thing
by their children and a proportionate amount of
ignorance as to what ought to be done. Therefore,
you may be able to carry on most profitably to all a
campaign of instruction in regard to such thing. You
will, of course, first make out as best you can with the
aid of all available literature, an ideal schedule of
hours of work and play and recreation suitable for
the boys and girls of the different ages.</p>

<p>At the holiday picnic it may be found advisable
to organize the boys into a club of their own and the
girls, likewise, for the promotion of their several
and mutual interests. Inspire all with your earnestness
and enthusiasm and lead them to consider the
latent possibilities of the neighborhood, of how it
might be transformed into a place of great worth and
attractiveness. At the same country picnic, look
to the practicability of organizing into a club the
tired mothers of the district. They are many. You
will know them by their careworn looks. Create a
sentiment in behalf of more frequent outings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
more recreation for these women. Help them obtain
literature relative to their own affairs, to exchange
ideas and plans in behalf of their own betterment.
Show them especially the possibility of quitting the
work at stated times even though that work be less
than half finished, and getting away from the tedium
thereof&mdash;all in the interest of longer life for themselves
and better service for their homes and families.
Almost any sort of club which these mothers
can be induced to attend will achieve the purpose
desired.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Federation for country life progress</span></h4>

<p>Federations for country-life progress are now
arising in many parts of the country. One of the
first was organized in New England, under the
leadership of President Butterfield. The Illinois
movement may be described, as an example.</p>

<p>The Illinois State Federation for Country Life
Progress is composed of nearly half a hundred subordinate
organizations. Their platform of ten principles
given below sets forth a number of most important
and practical purposes, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Local country community building.</p>

<p>2. The federation of all the rural forces of the
state of Illinois in one big united effort for the betterment
of country life.</p>

<p>3. The development of institutional programs of
action for all rural social agencies. This means a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>program of work for the school, another for the
church, another for the farmers&#8217; institute, and
so on.</p>

<p>4. The stimulation of farmer leadership in the
country community.</p>

<p>5. The increase and improvement of professional
leadership among country teachers, ministers, and all
others who serve the rural community in offices of
educational direction.</p>

<p>6. The perpetuation among all the people of country
communities of a definite community ideal, and
the concentrated effort of the whole community in
concrete tasks looking toward the realization of this
ideal.</p>

<p>7. The recognition of the country school as the
immediate initiator of progress in the average rural
community of Illinois.</p>

<p>8. The study and investigation of country life
facts and conditions.</p>

<p>9. The holding of annual country life conferences.</p>

<p>10. The protection of this federation and of all
country life from any form of exploitation.
</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The vocations of boys and girls</span></h4>

<p>A most commendable work for the rural social
leader would be that of showing the possibilities of
guiding country boys and girls more scientifically
in the direction of their coming vocational life. Too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
often, there may be found a mistaken farmer who is
attempting to force his boy to take up the farm life
when as a matter of fact the boy is in no sense fitted
for such vocation and should be trained for a distinctly
different line of work. Then, on another
occasion, you will meet a man who is farming simply
because he has to do it, and who is over-anxious that
his boy be guided in the direction of something else.
The point especially to be emphasized here is that
the parent cannot choose arbitrarily a vocation for
his child. The native interests of the latter must be
consulted again and again, while the child is growing
up, and in the end the young person must decide the
matter for himself.</p>

<p>The world is full of wrecks of human character
who are such largely because of the single fault of their
never having been trained scientifically in a vocational
way. So advance as best you can the idea that
parents must be most patient in awaiting the development
of the various instincts and desires in their
growing children, and for the final decision of the
latter in respect to a calling. It should be made
clear that many of the best and ablest men in the
world floundered about not a little in deciding upon
the final choice.</p>

<p>This very important matter of choosing a vocation
for the young man and the young woman
will be taken up in Chapters XVIII and XIX of
this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Other local possibilities</span></h4>

<p>It will be understood that the possibilities of church
and Sunday school work in a rural neighborhood are
not intentionally slighted. Little is said in regard
to them here simply because of the fact that there
is a country-wide organization with well-directed local
branches and with a flood of excellent literature
constantly at work in building up the church and
Sunday school life. The reader may be reminded,
however, that this field still presents many excellent
opportunities for serving the highest interests of
the home community.</p>

<p>The matter of purely social gatherings for the
boys and girls is important. It will perhaps be
found that they are running to cheap, degrading
dances, either in the home neighborhood or in a
near-by town. If the rural leader can break this
thing up and substitute a literary club, a better form
of social intercourse, or any other gathering, for the
cheap dance and its resultant debauch, the effort will
certainly be most commendable. It is not as a rule
advisable to condemn and denounce these cheap
affairs, but rather to begin at once a movement in
the interest of the better substitute. Just as soon as
the latter begins to take form, the young people will
naturally discontinue their degrading affairs. <a href="#Page_197">Chapter
XIII</a> of this book will offer a more extended
discussion of the social problems of country youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The boy-scout movement</span></h4>

<p>There is much to commend the boy-scout movement
as a country organization. It must be thought
of as an educative institution. In discussing its
best meanings and possibilities, Professor E. L.
Holton, of the Kansas State Agricultural College,
says: &#8220;Education as used here means habits of
health, of work, of thrift, of observation, and of research.
It is habit that determines the health of
an individual and the sanitary conditions of a
community; the social and moral level of the
worker and the quality of his work; the returns
from the farm and the ideals of the farmer; a man&#8217;s
bank account and his insight into the secrets of his
environment. Habit has its physical basis in the
flesh, the blood, and the nerve cells. There must
be actual first-hand experience and leadership
hitched up with text-book knowledge in educating
the boy. The old elemental instincts of adventure,
pugnacity, gang life, and following leadership must
be taken into account and made to work out into
life-compelling desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before attempting the organization of the local
Boy Scouts, one is advised first to send to the national
organization and that of the state, if there be any, for
literature and directions. The only caution which
it seems necessary to give here is that there be connected
with the conduct of the organization some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
serious problems and requirements and that it be
not given over exclusively to merely doing wild and
daring &#8220;stunts&#8221; and &#8220;hiking&#8221; about the country.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Rural boy-scouts in Kansas</span></h4>

<p>As an example of what is being done by way of
organizing the rural boy scout movement, the
Kansas plan under the direction of Professor E. L.
Holton is here given:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Agricultural College Council is organizing
companies of Rural-Life Boy Scouts in all parts of
Kansas. The aim of the Council is &#8220;a company
in every community.&#8221; There are 160,000 boys
in Kansas eligible to membership. It seeks to encourage
boys to learn the secrets of the prairies,
the streams and the forests, and be able to read
nature as well as books; to have a growing bank
account, and to do some type of work better than it
has been done by anyone else.</p>

<p>During the month of July or August there is to
be a five to ten days&#8217; Rural-Life Camp of Instruction
in each county, which is to be attended by all companies
of the county. This camp of instruction will
be under the direction and management of the
County Council. The program will consist of:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Games and athletic contests.</p>

<p>2. Contest in judging farm crops and stock.</p>

<p>3. Naming birds, wild animals, fish, flowers, trees,
shrubs, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>4. Reporting on the savings bank accounts.</p>

<p>5. Contests in any other line of work carried on
in the county.</p>

<p>6. Talks on rural life subjects.</p></blockquote>

<p>The duties of the individual scout are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the Third Class&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Know by sight and call ten common birds.</p>

<p>2. Know by sight and track ten wild animals.</p>

<p>3. Know by sight five common game fish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
<i>HOW MUCH WORK FOR THE COUNTRY BOY</i></h3>


<p>Over-work, poor pay, and little recreation are the
agencies which annually drive thousands of good,
promising youths from the rural districts into the
cities, where their splendid native abilities for serving
the world and society are most likely to become
subordinated. All too often it is a case of a young
man leaving the home place, surrounded by opportunities
which he has not been allowed to avail
himself of, and going into a place where he will take
up the monotonous round of merely &#8220;holding a job.&#8221;
In the former position, under intelligent care and
direction, he might have grown into a strong, self-reliant man,
full of resources, endued with good
purposes; and at last have taken rank among those
who are lifting the race to higher things. In the
position obtained in the city he is almost certain to
find his surroundings badly cramped, his spontaneity
largely restricted, and his power of initiative without
a motive for its indulgence. In short, his city
position will press him continually and insistently to
the end that he reduce himself to a mere machine,
or a mere cog in a great machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">See that the work is for the boy&#8217;s sake</span></h4>

<p>One of the means whereby rural parents may assist
their boy to develop into that fullness of life which
the latter&#8217;s native abilities and excellent environment
guarantee him, is to provide a scientific relation
of the young life to the work which he may be required
to perform. First of all, what is the proper
way in which to regard the boy&#8217;s work? Ordinarily,
the farmer is inclined to think of the work rather
than the worker, and to ask himself what he can
put the boy at in order to make his services most
profitable to the business. Now, no evil intention is
charged here, but this erroneous point of view is
almost certain to lead gradually to an abuse of the
boy. Why not put the question in this way: How
much work and what sort of work will be most
conducive to the boy&#8217;s present development and to
his future welfare? The radical difference between
the two positions may be readily seen. And while
the latter may be less profitable in form of material
and monetary gain, it will prove to be far more
serviceable in the production of sterling manhood.</p>

<p>It is not an easy matter to determine offhand as
to the amount of work a boy of any given age should
perform. Conditions vary greatly. The safest mode
of procedure is to study the individual boy carefully.
Let the parent first acquaint himself with the general
principles of human development through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
service of suitable literature, as recommended in a
former chapter. Then, the boy&#8217;s physical strength,
his aptitudes, and his native interests should be
taken into account. Among other aims, seek that
of a happy adjustment of the boy to his work. Some
of the tasks required of him will be and should be
somewhat irksome, as a means of discipline. On
the other hand, much of the work he does should be
backed up by his hearty approval and good will.</p>

<p>It is probably true that no boy is instinctively
fond of work and that the average boy must be held
to his tasks whether he chooses to perform them or
not. But the final pleasant relations of the boy to
his work can best be secured by means of counseling
with him on the subject. Explain to the lad the fact
that industry is the greatest factor in the world&#8217;s
progress and development. Point out to him
instances of worthy men, young and old, who are
faithful workers. Make him to see that he can the
better become an honorable man through an intimate
knowledge of labor. Point out to him instances of
men who are failures in life, and others who are
criminals, explaining&mdash;as statistics prove&mdash;that
the majority of these delinquent persons were never
trained during youth in the performance of any
specific work. Show him if possible how even
the wealthy person who has nothing important
to do, is a burden to himself and a menace to
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Not enforced labor, but mastery</span></h4>

<p>As stated above, no natural boy probably takes
up hard work willingly or voluntarily. Parents
may as well accept it as their peculiar duty to direct
and discipline their boys with required tasks. But
after considerable persistent and conscientious enforcement
of the boy&#8217;s labors the parent is almost
certain to be rewarded with the latter&#8217;s manifest
willingness and fondness in doing what was at first
thought of as pain and punishment.</p>

<p>It is a serious matter, however, to observe how
many grown men there are who look upon their work
with the dread and disfavor natural to little boys.
One is inclined to wonder at this and at the cause of
it. So far as can be learned by inquiry among
workmen and those who dread their enforced labor,
their view of the situations is about as follows, to
render liberally the language of a stonemason-philosopher:
&#8220;Work is something no man is naturally fond
of. Every worker would quit if he could afford
to and take life easy. If I had ten thousand dollars
ahead, I would never work another day. Of course
somebody has to work or we should all starve, but my
advice to a boy is that he get a good education and
thus learn how to make a living some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the parent who has true foresight in respect
to his child&#8217;s development is confronted with a serious
problem. It is not merely a matter of teaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
boy to work, but rather that of teaching him to
become master of his work in order that personal
pleasure may finally come from the performance
thereof. So, one must follow the boy most thoughtfully
in the latter&#8217;s initial steps toward satisfactory
industry. While it is sometimes advisable to take
him forcibly back to the place where he failed and
even to enforce obedience and effort with the rod,
it is most certainly the parent&#8217;s duty to praise the
small lad for his first light tasks well performed, and
otherwise to show appreciation thereof.</p>

<p>&#8220;It took me a year to get this boy down to business,&#8221;
said the proud father of a fifteen-year-old
who had just won a second prize in a state-wide
corn-raising contest. &#8220;During the summer of his
sixth year I took him with me into the field on
occasions when he could do something light and learn
from it. But my chief plan was to train him in
garden work. I gave him a small plot to tend and
helped him lay it out and plant it. At first he showed
great interest, but I knew that it was of the playful
kind and that it would soon wane. Sure enough,
in a short time he was dodging and slighting his
garden work. Then, I began a more definite method.
At morning I would instruct him very carefully what
he must do for the day, and at each evening I required
him to compare results and instructions with me.
Punishment was necessary more than once, but
slowly he began to catch my point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>&#8220;I bought the boy&#8217;s first spring radishes for table
use and permitted him to spend half the money.
This seemed to open his eyes. Later I paid him for
his other produce. During the second season I
emphasized such matters as carefulness in selecting
seed and the arrangement and cultivation of the
garden produce. Several of the neighbors expressed
surprise and delight when they saw the attractive
garden. This merited approbation was noticeably
effective. Since that time I have had little trouble.
I can give that boy any ordinary farm problem to-day
and he will work it out most enthusiastically.
He has learned the joy of mastery in his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foregoing somewhat lengthy statement is
given with the thought that it may furnish illustrative
material to others. It is a mistake to keep driving
boys to their work &#8220;just because they ought to do
it,&#8221; as one stern father put the matter. But it is
altogether fair and advisable that a series of rewards
be offered. The youth must be made to feel that
his work is to serve some worthy personal end.
This well-trained boy&#8217;s reward came gradually as
follows: (1) parental approbation. (2) a money
return. (3) the praise of the neighbors, (4) the
joy of self-reliance and mastery.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Provide vacations for the boy</span></h4>

<p>It is unreasonable to expect the growing boy to
have the same vital interest in the work as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
his parents. The wise father will see to it that his
youthful son has some outside incentive for work,
as well as money payments and words of praise.
Vacation periods and holidays judiciously placed
will prove a splendid tonic for the working boy&#8217;s
mind. The schedule given below will indicate the
relative amount of time that should be given to such
recreative indulgences. Even in the matter of
holidays there is a tendency of some fathers to regard
them as so much stock in trade to exchange
for the boy&#8217;s extra effort. So, some farmers will
map out more than a reasonable week&#8217;s work and
say, &#8220;Now, boys, finish that up by Saturday noon
and you may quit.&#8221; In such case we have mere
exploitation of the boy&#8217;s strength and energy in
the interest of the work and the profits. The scheme
will fall flat sooner or later and leave the boy still
despising the work and mistrustful of his employer.</p>

<p>The plan pursued by a prosperous farmer in dealing
with his two sons may serve to illustrate a very
good method. This thoughtful father reports substantially
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The work on our place is never ended, but whenever
I find that the boys need a vacation they get it
just the same. They are fourteen and sixteen and
splendid help during the summer. I never permit
them to work more than ten hours a day, while they
are allowed a full half day off each week to use as they
please, and about once each month they have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
entire day to themselves. Also during the hot
weather in the middle of the summer they have
from three days to a week for some special outing.
Last summer they camped out five days with some
other good boys. It is my theory that the boys who
are given such vacations will do more work and do it
better than those who are not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The foregoing plan may seem to sacrifice the interests
of the work, but in fact it really does not. After
all, it is merely a question of the right point of view.
Is the boy for the sake of the work, or the work for
the sake of the boy? Answer the question conscientiously
for yourself, dear reader. And may the
boy be forever the gainer!</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A tentative schedule of hours</span></h4>

<p>Obedience may be regarded as a pre-requisite
for successful boy training. So, the first light
tasks required of the small lad will be intended as
merely a means of training him to obey and to feel
the meaning of responsibility. No one has thus
far seemed to think it worth while to attempt
to prescribe for the work and play of children. How
different in the case of the school requirements!
Even in the district schools the thing is reduced
to a system&mdash;<i>both the quantity and the quality of
the work necessary for each age and grade are carefully
scheduled</i>. Now, why not the same forethought
in planning the necessary amount of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
exercises? And why not have this scheme made
out by <i>highly trained experts</i> as is the case with the
school course? There seems to be no plausible
defense for this traditional expensive oversight on
the part of society.</p>

<p>The schedule below is offered as merely schematic
and possibly suggestive. In any given case there
may be wide departures from it. But the thought is
that of training the whole boy, and that for the sake
of his own and society&#8217;s future good.</p>

<p>Age 4 or younger.&mdash;May be taught the nature of
a required duty from being sent on an occasional
small errand about the place. Practically all the
time should be given to play.</p>

<p>Age 5.&mdash;Use substantially the same methods as
for age 4, but add the requirement of one regular
light task daily and follow him up in the performance
of it.</p>

<p>Age 6.&mdash;Continue as above, adding to the required
tasks slightly. If the lad now be taken to the field,
he must go more in the spirit of play than of work.
Of course he will learn much about farm matters
at this age, but his activities will be largely spontaneous.
Note the plan reported above.</p>

<p>Age 7.&mdash;At this age, the boy should be required to
do light chores at evening after school&mdash;such as
carrying in wood and kindling and attending to the
stock. Or he may help in the house. During
vacation he may help for two to four hours daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
with some easy tasks, preferably about the house.
Of course there is much work about the barn and
fields which is not too heavy for him.</p>

<p>Age 8.&mdash;Some boys are put to plowing at this age,
but such a thing is little short of criminal. Moreover,
they should be held regularly to <i>no sort of work</i>
all day long at this age; that is, unless the parent
desires to reduce his boy to a little old dried-up man
before the age of twenty is reached, and perhaps
drive him from home.</p>

<p>Age 9.&mdash;Intermittently half-day or all-day tasks
may now be imposed; provided the lad be taken
along as a mere helper and may, about two-thirds
of the time, either play at his work or regard it in the
light of a playful pastime. Do not work the joyousness
and spontaneity out of him at this young age.</p>

<p>Age 10.&mdash;An average of five hours solid work per
day is all that the 10-year-old farm boy should be
required to do. Much play and recreation of the
rougher sort should supplement it. The desire to
construct something with tools is now strong and
should be indulged. Or, see that he has a pony to
ride as he hurries about the place in the performance
of his many errands.</p>

<p>Age 11.&mdash;Increase the required tasks about one
hour per day with similar treatment as for age 10.
This is the age for training the boy to be a sort of
&#8220;page&#8221; in service of his mother and sister.</p>

</div>

<p>Age 12.&mdash;Many 12-year-old boys are required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
do a man&#8217;s work every day. But such a thing is
done in the interest of the work and the profits and
not for the sake of the boy. A good way to measure
his worth at this age is to see that he does not earn
more than half as much as the full-grown man.
Give many half-holidays. His interest in fishing,
rowing, swimming, and the like, needs much indulgence.</p>

<p>Age 13.&mdash;From this age to 15, watch the boy
for the beginning of adolescence and be unusually
careful not to over-work him. Most of his bodily
strength must go into making new bone and muscle.
Frequent intervals of rest and relaxation should
be the rule, together with avoidance of too long
and too heavy a day&#8217;s work. Even permit some
crops to be lost rather than abuse the boy.</p>

<p>Age 14-16.&mdash;This is the time to begin to interest
the boy in working to serve his own ends. His
social instincts will now appear strong and he will
desire many new possessions not hitherto thought of.
Therefore, adjust his work to these new interests
and lead him to feel as much as possible that he is
working for his own advantage. There is still danger
of over-work. So see to it that rests and vacations
with opportunities for social experience are frequent.
It is a matter for parental concern if the farm boy
be not able to return to his labors at the beginning
of each new day with freshness of spirits and overflowing
energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Think out a reasonable plan</span></h4>

<p>Finally, the farmer is urged to take up the matter
for consideration early and make out what seems a
reasonable plan of relating the boy to his work, and
then to adhere persistently thereto. It has been
charged repeatedly that the typical well-to-do
farmer works his wife and children hard all day and
until late bed time in the evening; that heavy chores
are piled upon the boys after they have already
worked overtime in the field; that they are routed
out at four o&#8217;clock every morning, when they go
half asleep and moaning to their work again.</p>

<p>If the foregoing accusation be at all true, its truth
must certainly be the result of carelessness and ignorance
of human rights, and not premeditative inhumanity
and criminality as it seems to be! The
reading of good farm literature, together with
some intensive study of books and periodicals on
the care and management of children&mdash;these will
most certainly prove corrective agencies of some
of the abuses named herein.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
<i>HOW MUCH WORK FOR THE COUNTRY GIRL</i></h3>


<p>Imagine a wedding scene in a rural home. The
only daughter, a young woman of ideal age for
marriage, is joining her heart and her hand, for
weal or for woe, to those of a young man of suitable
character. But strange and unexpected as it may
seem, there are many tears on the part of the immediate
relatives of the girl. Her parents are manifesting
the strange emotion of solemnity at a time
when gaiety might be expected. Why is it? you
ask. The whole situation has an interesting and
inspiring history. It is simply this: During all
her years the parents of this girl have watched her
grow up, through infancy, childhood, maidenhood,
and finally into the full maturity of a woman; and
every stage of her growth has been carefully safe-guarded
by them. They have made the home life
and the home work serve her needs and purposes in a
most beautiful and instructive manner. They seem
to have attempted at all times to put into their
daughter&#8217;s life just such experience as would become
a helpful part of her growing character. And what
a reward! What a splendid satisfaction to the
worthy parents to be able to contribute to society
such a product of their affectionate care and training!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A balanced life for the girl</span></h4>

<p>Should we follow it out, the biography of the
good young woman mentioned above would teach
many a valuable lesson to the parents of other girls&mdash;would
teach them that a growing girl has her specific
needs and her inherent rights, which must be provided
for by her parents through the proper kind of directing
and caretaking. A certain amount of restraint,
of work, of play, of recreation, of social experiences,
of practice in self-dependence, of opportunity for
service of others&mdash;yes, a certain amount of all these
things must be conscientiously supplied for the life
of the growing girl so that she may develop into a
well-rounded character.</p>

<p>Parents are not accused of intentional wrong to
their daughters. Such cases are rare. The chief
sins against the daughters of the rural homes are
the sins of neglect, of indifference, and of ignorance as
to what were necessary to be done. So what we
may accomplish in this chapter is, first to arouse
parents to an appreciation of the seriousness of the
problem before them; and second, to offer some
specific aids to the better achievement of the task of
bringing up a girl to the rural home.</p>

<p>It is a well-established principle in plant propagation
that certain nutrient elements must be present
in the soil before growth will go on properly. It
does not satisfy the needs of the plant for some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the chemical substances to be present in large amount
if the others be absent. There must be a sort of
balanced ration for the vegetable life. Similarly
in case of that tender plant of the household, the
young girl; she can be kept alive on work and
study alone, but for beautiful and symmetrical
growth other elements of character-nourishment are
necessary. What are they? The reader is referred
to <a href="#Page_1">Chapter I</a> for a general list.</p>

<p>The hurry of work and the isolation of the ordinary
country home tend to foster an over-serious disposition
in girls. There is too little to provoke a smile
and not half enough practice in smiling. Laughter is
also too infrequent. A boy may grow up habitually
stern and sedate and yet be able to fight his way
through a successful manhood. But with the girl
it is different. Her habit of smiling and of being
pleasant and agreeable may prove to be one of
her most valuable charms. So, the early and continuous
training of the girl in sociability must be
considered among the parental duties to her; and
that by encouraging her to be sociable at home and
by providing that she have frequent companionship
with others of her age.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Work begins with obedience</span></h4>

<p>One of the initial steps in the training of a child
is that of securing a willing obedience, a habitual
performance of required tasks and duties. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
prove an easy matter to drive the girl to the work.
But how about the problem of teaching her to take
up her daily tasks willingly and with a joyous heart?
Girls are little different from boys at this stage of
their education. They do not take naturally and
fondly to work. They will slight and neglect it.
Worse than that, if untrained in faithfulness to
household duties, they will lounge about the place or
run much in society and allow their mothers to
work themselves slowly to death&mdash;and scarcely seem
to realize what is taking place.</p>

<p>Similarly as in case of the boy, some forcing, some
rebuke, and occasional punishment will be necessary
to initiate the girl into the work habit. But shortly
obedience and willingness will come, and with them
a deeper consciousness than is manifested in her
young brother. After that, the danger of over-work
will soon begin to be apparent to the watchful
mother, and be guarded against.</p>

<p>Habit formation is a prominent factor in the first
lessons of obedience in work. It will be highly
advisable to start everything right. After a few
instances of slighting one kind of work or expending
too much energy upon another kind the young
character begins to take on these faults permanently.
Many women scrub floors and wash dishes unto
their death. Others perform these endless tasks
quite as well &#8220;in a jiffy&#8221; and go on their way singing.
Why is this? Is it not a matter which the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
should think about most seriously in relation to the
training of her daughter?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Working the girls in the field</span></h4>

<p>Is there any justification for requiring a girl to
work in the field with the men and boys? Many
girls are doing so, whether required or not. Careful
consideration of the matter seems to bring out a few
suggestions. The farm girl while a child under ten
years may accompany the father or the brothers into
the field and there be permitted to do some light
work occasionally, provided she regard it in a
semi-playful way. On very rare occasions, when
older, she may be rightfully called on to drive a rake
for a day or take some similar part of the work in
order to help prevent the loss of a valuable crop.</p>

<p>But the practice followed by some farmers, of often
requiring their daughters to do a man&#8217;s work in the
field, and excusing the fault with the thought that
it is for the sake of laying up wealth for her future
enjoyment&mdash;that is abominable and should be
prohibited by law. Among other objections, it is
probably most hurtful to the young woman&#8217;s pride
and self-respect to be forced to perform farm labor.
And then, during such time as she works in the
field her much needed opportunities for the practice
of the womanly arts and refinements are slipping
away.</p>

<p>Of course we should not take away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
country-reared woman the poetic sentiment about the
days of her childhood when she helped rake the hay
and drive the cattle home, &#8220;just for fun.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Some specific suggestions</span></h4>

<p>It is difficult, of course, to lay down specific
rules here, because every case is a special one. But
nearly all intelligent parents can easily determine
whether or not they are fair to their girls. It would
seem reasonable that in addition to the affection and
interest properly bestowed upon her in the home,
the daughter should have at least the same measure
of value&mdash;money value&mdash;put upon her work
as is the rule with the hired helper. Certainly no
worthy parent would ask her to work for a smaller
sum.</p>

<p>Too many of these good, promising girls are
cramped and limited in their lives until the self-pride
is crushed well-nigh out of them. Often such young
women will be seen moping about in a stooped
attitude of body, stiff and awkward in their manners,
lacking in self-confidence and in that beautiful
grace and ease of movement which mark the well-developed
young woman of twenty years. All of
this is more or less indicative of parental disregard
and mistreatment&mdash;indicative that some one has
cheated her out of the time that should have been
allowed for rest and recreation and social improvement
and given her in exchange an over-amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
grinding toil and enforced seclusion&mdash;<i>all for the
sake of the work and the profits</i>.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that so many country mothers
make no provision for throwing extra safeguards
around their young daughter during the monthly
period of physical drain and weakness. It could
probably be shown that her lowered vitality and the
increased susceptibility to fatigue at this time make
almost complete rest and relaxation highly advisable.
It is also most probable that the strain of work and
the exposure to inclement weather, so often allowed
during the monthly period, are the incipient causes
of life-long weakness and disease.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Do you own your daughter?</span></h4>

<p>There are still not a few parents who are possessed
of the old-fashioned idea that their children belong
to them, that they have a proprietary right in
their own sons and daughters. Just now there is
thought of a father who is intelligent, in many
ways above the average man, but who seems to
regard his twenty-three-year-old daughter as a
sort of chattel. Being a widower, he needs her
services, so he would employ her at the least possible
wages, or none, to take charge of the home, rear the
two or three smaller children, and cook and keep
house for himself and three or four hired men. The
best excuse that may be offered for this man&#8217;s
attitude toward his daughter is sheer ignorance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the true meaning of the situation. But such treatment
of a mature daughter is little short of cruelty.
This young woman should have every possible opportunity
just now to prepare herself for the future.
Her conduct for the present may even have the
appearance of being somewhat selfish in order that her
future well-being and that of those dependent upon
her may be safe-guarded.</p>

<p>Further details of the foregoing case need not be
given. The issue to be made out of it is this: The
parent who is doing the fair and square thing by
his daughter not only trains her to work and then
safeguards her life against an over-amount of work,
but he also sees to it that the labor she performs is
contributive to her enjoyment, to the strengthening
of her character, and to the perfection of her life for
the future. Parents are justified in using every
possible means as contributory to the future well-being
of their growing daughters, and all this for
the sake of the generations yet unborn. Thus,
perhaps without realizing the fact at all, the former
may return to the race life that measure of assistance
which they themselves received.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Difficult to make a schedule</span></h4>

<p>It is difficult to make out a schedule of hours
for the growing girl as we did for the boy, but the
former chapter may be taken as a general guide. As
with the boy, so with the girl, the first step in disci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>pline
is that of securing a willing obedience. Then
the tasks may be assigned in accordance with the
girl&#8217;s age and strength. There is no good reason
for attempting to get work out of the child through
a make-believe policy of play. Children had better
be made to understand from the first that the world
we live in is constructed largely through work; and
that labor is honorable and may even be made
pleasurable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should rather do the work myself than be
bothered with trying to get the children to do it,&#8221; is
a very common expression, and one which indicates
an erroneous idea of the problem we are considering.
So long as parents put their children at the tasks
merely for the sake of getting the tasks done, the
children will suffer as a consequence. But if the
thought of the child&#8217;s need of the discipline coming
from work be uppermost, then, the results are
likely to be wholesome.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Teach the girl self-supremacy</span></h4>

<p>One of the greatest problems of the future of the
race is involved in the fact that many thousands of
the best young women in the land&mdash;young women
who are well fitted to be the mothers of a better
race of human beings than we now have&mdash;are
choosing an independent calling for themselves. It
is the author&#8217;s belief that one of the most tragic
experiences known to any considerable portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>American people is this gradual starvation of the
maternal instinct usually necessary in the case of
the well-sexed young woman of the class just mentioned.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXII.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="Fig_29" name="Fig_29"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxii.png" width="600" height="305" alt="" title="Plate XXII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 29.&mdash;An industrial exhibit in a country school. If the boys and girls could enjoy frequently the refining
experience of having their work observed by approving eyes, their appointed tasks would seem lighter.</span>
</div>

<p>And yet much of this fatal choice of an independent
vocation on the part of many young women doubtless
results from bad management of the growing girl.
In too many country homes especially, the work
is complete master of the housekeeper and not the
converse, as the case should be. As a result, thousands
of good women who ought to be in the pink
and prime of life are going pathetically to the only
rest which the conditions seem to allow&mdash;the grave.
It is an awful thing, this wreck of so many good lives
through over-work. Under such conditions, may
we reasonably censure the many young women who
foresee such a fate as a possibility for themselves
and avoid it through choice of an unmarried life
and independent support?</p>

<p>Girls are more readily enslaved to work than boys.
It is comparatively easy to teach a young woman to
work, but it is an extremely difficult matter to teach
her when and how to quit work. Here, then, is
the point whereat we would center the attention of
the parents of the country girl. Make her mistress
of her work. Develop in her by actual concrete
lessons the ability to stop and rest or take recreation
at the necessary time, even though the work be
not half done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>1. Give the girl a trifling daily task at four or five
years of age, merely for the sake of discipline. See
to it, however, that her young life be occupied chiefly
in play and enjoyment and outdoor recreation.</p>

<p>2. Gradually increase the amount of work required,
but always with an eye single to the girl&#8217;s physical
growth and character-development. Some definite
thing to do as a regular daily requirement will prove
most helpful.</p>

<p>3. Continue throughout the daughter&#8217;s growing
years to provide for her pleasure. Her schooling,
her personal belongings, her social advantages, and
the like, must all be made to serve the purpose of
making her life in the home a happy one. As she
grows in strength and years, she will assume the
increased amount of work with willingness and even
with pleasure, provided the assigned duties be vitally
related to her present purposes and her life
interests.</p>

<p>4. Moreover, country parents must learn to think
of themselves as first of all engaged in bringing up
their children for a better human society; and secondly,
as engaged in farming and housekeeping. If
this point of view be held to persistently, the crops
may often suffer and the housework frequently remain
unfinished, but the vital interests of the
boys and girls will continue ever to be served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>5. Finally, let us continue to appreciate the value
of outings and vacations as potent factors in relieving
the drudgery of work about the country household.
Women&#8217;s work in the country home naturally calls
for much isolation and seclusion. The pre-adolescent
girl should be taken out of the farm home once
or twice per week during the summer vacation.
It is good for her to go with her mother to the town
market and to the women&#8217;s club meetings. As soon
as she enters young womanhood, a square deal for
the girl who helps in the home will call for a weekly
outing of some kind and a careful provision for her
social needs. All of this outside intercourse will
serve to quicken the body and the intellect of the
girl as she goes daily about the household duties,
and to give her</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
<i>SOCIAL TRAINING FOR FARM BOYS AND
GIRLS</i></h3>


<p>We have been exceedingly slow in realizing the
social needs of our children, in the usual instance
depending on chance conditions to determine the
matter for us. The city and the rural communities
present a striking contrast in this respect. It does
not seem possible that both can be right, while there
is much to support the opinion that both are wrong.
That is to say, in the city community the majority
of the children are allowed to spend too much time
in the company of others. As a result, they take on
social manners and customs in a mere formal way and
by far too early for the good of their character-development.
The city ripens young life too fast.
It produces the manners and refinements of adult
life before the child becomes matured mentally. In
the ordinary rural community there is not enough
social experience for the young; and hence, a certain
amount of crudeness, awkwardness, and lack of
refinement tend to linger permanently in the character.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A happy mean is needed</span></h4>

<p>What seems necessary, therefore, is the establishment
of a social life which will be a compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
between the excess of the city and the deficit of the
country. So far as can be learned, very little has
been achieved in the matter of establishing just such a
social order in the rural communities as will tend
to develop the lives of the boys and girls in an ideal,
symmetrical way. We may not feel very certain
as to just how this ideal juvenile society should be
constructed. Nevertheless, an attempt will be made
to sketch in this chapter a working plan therefor.
Some may see fit to adapt it, while others may improve
it through practice.</p>

<p>What especially needs to be thought of in the development
of any normal young life is the problem
of rounding out the character on all sides. There
are certain fundamental character-forming experiences
and disciplines, such as work, play, recreation,
and social intercourse. Many parents seem to be
possessed of the idea that they can develop their
children through play and social training alone.
Others seem to believe that hard work and plenty of
it is all that is necessary for the development of a
substantial character in the young. Still others
appear to allow their boys and girls to roam at will
and to indulge them only in the recreative experiences.
But how indefensible the idea that anyone
should try to find permanent joy and satisfaction
through recreative experiences without first having
had as their counterpart the experience of work and
the responsibilities that pertain thereto!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>So, again, it may be contended that there is a happy
mean between the over-work and the absence of social
experience so common in the farming communities
and the lack of work and the extreme social excitement
that so often obtains in the life of the city child.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A social renaissance in the country</span></h4>

<p>There is becoming more and more apparent the
necessity of not only a revival of the social life in the
country, but also the demand for its reconstruction.
It is especially to be desired that the reorganization
be effected under the guidance of sound principles of
psychology and sociology. That is, it must be based
on the fundamental fact of the sex instinct so prominent
during the adolescent period, and the further
fact of the imperative demand at this time for a large
amount of social intercourse. How differently this
point of view persistently held will shape the matter
as compared with the older ideal of merely &#8220;giving
the young folks a good time&#8221;! Yes, the social life
of adolescent boys and girls has its source in the sex
instinct then so predominant. It is not therefore
to be viewed as a piece of superficial sentimentality,
but rather as a profound law of nature.</p>

<p>As suggested by two or three of the preceding
chapters, there may be organized a social center in
the church, or other such centers may develop independently
through the leadership of some mature
persons. But instances of this class of effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
organization are as yet few and far between. Meanwhile,
the young are growing up and their present
social needs are very pressing. Individual farmers
cannot wait for neighborhood movements; and so
the parents of the children requiring the social life
must themselves take the initiative in the matter.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Conditions to guard against</span></h4>

<p>Before proceeding to a detailed outline of various
plans for supplying the social needs of rural young
people, it may be well to point out a few of the pitfalls
to be guarded against. In reference to the latter, it
is not the purpose to advise parents to try to place
their children in an exclusive social set. Far from
that. The purpose is rather the converse; namely,
to urge parents to attempt to build up good, clean
characters in their boys and girls and yet permit the
latter to mingle freely with common humanity. An
aristocracy in the towns and cities is bad enough and
a thing wholly out of harmony with the best and highest
interpretation of our national life; but an aristocracy
in the country neighborhood is an abomination.</p>

<p>But while the so-called best families must think
of their young as growing members of the entire social
community and not as belonging to an exclusive set,
there is nevertheless great need of constant watchfulness
in respect to certain evils that always threaten
the lives of farmers&#8217; sons and daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>1. <i>The social companionships of girls.</i>&mdash;Of course
it must be admitted that there is frequently present
in the country neighborhood some vile or wicked
young character whose influence is very pernicious.
On one occasion this person may appear in the guise
of an exemplary young man, smooth in manners,
stylishly dressed, and apparently interested in the
best affairs. But as a matter of fact, he may be
secretly an agent for some infamous institution in the
city. The records show that thousands of country
girls have been enticed away to the cities by such
characters only to meet an untimely and awful fate.
The parents of the country girl should therefore know
who the young man is with whom she keeps company.
Usually it is a comparatively easy matter to test his
worth. If he have no fixed local attachment in a
home, and no permanent business relations in the
community, he may be regarded with suspicion at
least, and may be compelled to furnish evidence of his
moral integrity.</p>

<p>Another type of the young country man unworthy
of the company and companionship of the young
woman is the one who is known by the men of the
community as being habituated to the use of vile
and indecent language, or to the practice of drinking
intoxicants. If such be among his known characteristics,
the evidence is decidedly unfavorable,
making him unsuitable as a social companion of the
country girl. It is reasonable to predict that he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
never change his ways very radically, and especially
that he will not develop into a desirable life companion
for the daughter. Some good parents make the
fatal blunder of allowing their girl to keep company
with such a coarse-grained young man simply because
he is so &#8220;good hearted,&#8221; and &#8220;means well,&#8221;
and the like. To say the least, a depraved social taste
will gradually develop in the girl&#8217;s life if she continue
in such company.</p>

<p>Another contamination for the country girl sometimes
results from the depraved young woman who
has drifted into the neighborhood. The girl herself
will be in the best position to detect such a type, as
the latter will be marked by her coarse manners when
in the presence of the girls, and by her practice of
discussing obscene matters in private conversation
with them. This is the situation in which the innocent
young girl&#8217;s mind may become forever poisoned
and her wholesome faith in humanity entirely too
much unsettled.</p>

<p>2. <i>Bad companionships for boys.</i> Similar warnings
as those given above need to be sounded with reference
to the young country boys, and others as well.
Farm boys are necessarily much in the company of
men of very common tastes and low ideals. They
hear not a little evil conversation and profanity, as
it is used by such men. As a result, there will be
need of much constructive teaching at home. Admonitions,
warnings, and advice will be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>In every instance it is well for the parents to remind
the boy of the great interest they have in his welfare,
of how deeply he may grieve them by taking up any
of the evil practices in question, and of the high ideal
which they hold in mind for his future.</p>

<p>Farm parents will need to keep up an intimate and
frank exchange of ideas with their youthful son on
the general subjects discussed in this chapter. They
may ask him to repeat all he has heard and to relate
all he has seen, good and bad, they then offering
their corrections and admonitions. The especial
danger is that the boy may acquire evil forms of
speech, pernicious ideas for his secret thoughts, and a
too low estimate of the worth of humanity. The
vile companion is especially inclined to make the
youth believe that there is no purity of character
among girls and women&mdash;a most lamentable state
of mind for a boy or a man of any age.</p>

<p>The boy in the country is not only very much in
danger of having his mind contaminated by the evil
speech and the evil misinformation mentioned above,
but there is always the possibility of his being enticed
by some older and depraved companion into the
company of evil women. Strange to say, there are a
few men who seem to plan deliberately this form of
downfall for innocent boys and to regard the success
of their vile plot in the light of a mere joke. It is
perhaps a fault of society that such men are permitted
to run at large. And it is especially the fault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of fathers if such men keep company with their boys.
No matter how excellent the family history, how well-born
the boy may be, and how carefully he has been
admonished, there is always some danger of his
yielding to an evil sex temptation&mdash;a situation which
the parent should always be watchful about and ready
to meet.</p>

<p>3. <i>Secret sex habits.</i>&mdash;It is probable that country
boys are more prone to secret perversions of their sex
life than are city boys. The enforced solitude of the
former and the increased opportunities for such secret
evil may be accountable for the difference. In any
event, there is necessity of constant watchfulness,
and that especially until the son has reached comparative
maturity of the physical body. The danger
is at its height at the beginning of the adolescent
period, fourteen to sixteen years of age. But the
preparation for meeting the possible sex perversion
should be begun very early and consist in frank talks
and admonitions. The small boy&#8217;s questions about
the origin of life must be answered frankly but only
to the extent of imparting to him enough information
to satisfy his present curiosity. Thus to satisfy
his childish curiosity will prove a means of counteracting
the evil influences of the bad companionships
referred to above. Then, the youth needs to be
shown some instances of the ruinous effects of sex
perversion in boys and men, together with the inculcation
of the idea that any such evil practice will cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
off the possibility of his realizing the high standards of
moral character set for him. It is well also to remember
that prevention of the boy&#8217;s misuse of his sex
life is comparatively easy and that cure is extremely
difficult.</p>

<p>4. <i>The so-called bad habits.</i>&mdash;When we speak of
the &#8220;bad habits&#8221; among boys and men we are inclined
to think of swearing, smoking, and the use of
intoxicants. Without thought of defending the
practice of profanity, we may say that it is often
acquired in an innocent fashion and that it ordinarily
implies no conscious or intentional evil. That is, it
is usually not so bad in its actual analysis as it sounds
to the listener. Moreover, it is a habit which many
boys take up and afterwards discontinue when once
they have set up for themselves high standards of
manliness.</p>

<p>With juvenile smoking the case is different. Without
the thought of offending the adult smoker or
defending adult smoking, we may say with a high
degree of certainty that the use of tobacco is extremely
hurtful to growing boys. It weakens and
deranges the organic processes, leaves its deleterious
effects in the throat, eyes, and lungs, and breaks down
the natural constitutional defense so essential in
time of such diseases as pneumonia and typhoid
fever. On the mental side, tobacco lessens the boy&#8217;s
ability to study. Very wide investigations have
shown that the habitual smokers among school boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
rank low in scholarship; that they are prone to fail
in their classes and quit the schools; that almost none
of them take high rank as students. The moral
effects are even worse. In times of temptation the
young boy who smokes is more inclined to yield
and to choose the worse form of conduct instead of
the better. He lacks especially that fine sense of
inner worth so necessary for the one who would
succeed in arousing his own moral courage sufficiently
to withstand the temptations that naturally beset
young life. The rural parents will not of course
despair about the boy or turn against him should
they discover that he has secretly become confirmed
in the use of tobacco. There are still possibilities of
his development into a substantial character; but
because of his smoking the problem becomes a much
more involved and difficult one.</p>

<p>All that has just been said in reference to tobacco
may be emphasized many fold in respect to intoxicants.
To allow a growing boy to begin the use of
intoxicating drink in any form seems to be wholly
indefensible. However, if there are open saloons
in the adjoining town or city, even the best country
boys are always somewhat in danger of taking the
first false step. Rural parents must not be satisfied
with the thought that their boy is &#8220;too good&#8221; to
take up such a thing; they must be assured that he
is not doing so. Now, the only way to obtain such
assurance is by means of keeping in intimate touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
with the boy and his movements&mdash;by knowing when
and where he goes, why he goes there, and whom he
meets in the various places visited on his rounds.
Thus, he may be saved from a life of debauch and
degradation, and that by means of providing carefully
that he reach his full maturity of mind and
body without any knowledge of the taste of intoxicating
drinks.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A center of community life</span></h4>

<p>As explained in a number of preceding chapters,
there are being carried out several plans for bringing
about a social awakening in the farm districts. Some
of these are succeeding admirably, especially the
county Y.M.C.A., and in a few instances the rural
church. But presumably there are many thousands
of country districts wherein these helpful agencies
will not be found for many years to come. So, in
the following lines there will be an attempt to furnish
detailed methods and suggestions to rural parents
who are under the necessity of assisting their
own children in a social way. The discussion thus
far has been of a somewhat destructive order. Now,
something of a constructive nature will be offered.</p>

<p>The first essential in the awakening of a clean social
life for the young is a center of effort. If there be
no church or clubhouse of any kind within easy access
of all, then the farm home may be made use of for
this service. There are many advantages in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
common country home as a social center for the
young, among them being the probable presence of
some sympathetic parent to offer guidance and to
keep down unbecoming conduct.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Invite the young to the house</span></h4>

<p>So, if country parents are really in earnest about
doing something to develop their own children in a
social way, let them throw open their own homes for
the purpose. In a certain Iowa home this thing was
done in an admirable manner. Let the father tell
the story in his own language:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;For years we had a room in the house which we
called the &#8216;parlor.&#8217; It contained some expensive
furniture which the members of the family scarcely
ever saw, as the place was usually kept closed up and
dark. Why we reserved such a dark, musty room
for the &#8216;special company&#8217; that came two or three
times each year, I do not know. At any rate, we
decided to make the place useful. In remodeling the
house we enlarged it to 16 by 20 feet in size and
added one very large window.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 30.&mdash;An agricultural and domestic science club in Oklahoma. Without being so named, it is also distinctively
a social club, and a splendid socializing and refining agency.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Here we made a society room for the young people
of the neighborhood. Extra chairs were obtained,
also a large new stove and fixtures for gaslights.
There were also some simple wall decorations and
a small library and reading table. That was two
years ago. Since then our two boys and two girls
have given many parties in that room and no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>has got more enjoyment out of the affairs than their
parents. We feel as if that room was the best investment
we ever made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not nearly all anxious parents may be so situated
as to follow the excellent plan described above, but
it is certainly worthy of a trial by all who can avail
themselves of its benefits. Best of all, the young
people in whose behalf this thoughtful endeavor is
put forth will most certainly grow to maturity confirmed
in the belief that the country life is not lacking
in its social enjoyments.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">How to conduct a social entertainment</span></h4>

<p>In giving a social entertainment to the young
people of the country, there are a few simple yet
common matters to be observed. First of all, there
is the frequent tendency toward reticence or backwardness.
It will be remembered, of course, that the
object of the occasion is not merely passing amusement
for the young, but also that of furnishing some
means of character-development. In fact, the author
wishes that every chapter of this book be thought of
as contributing something toward the building up of
young lives. So, in case of the home party, it will be
necessary to see that every one present takes some
active part. The bashful youth who is merely permitted
to sit by and look on will go home secretly
displeased, if not much pained, at his own backwardness.
He may even fail to appear again on such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
occasion, and thus the availability of a most helpful
agency be permanently lost to him.</p>

<p>It is not therefore so much a question of the dignity
and importance of the games played as it is a
question of the active engagement of every one present
in the amusements. Much will depend on leadership.
An able leader will have the group organized
before the several members realize what is being
done. An expert student and director of young
people was seen on a certain occasion to take charge
of a party of forty boys and girls ranging in age from
fifteen to twenty years. These were quickly placed
standing in two parallel lines of twenty each. Each
side was given a dish of unhulled peanuts and asked
to engage in a contest of passing the nuts down the
line one at a time, from hand to hand, the one at
the farther end of the line placing the nuts in a
receptacle. This simple game &#8220;broke the ice&#8221; for
the entire evening. After that it was easy to keep
the entertainment going.</p>

<p>The supervisor of the social affair is advised to
discourage all games that tend to an over-amount of
silliness and that allow for undue familiarity of the
sexes. There is, however, a dignified form of fun
and merriment quite as enjoyable as the baser sort.
And, too, the leader of the evening need not be reminded
of the many little opportunities for inculcating
wholesome lessons in dignified manners. Many
a &#8220;green&#8221; and awkward country youth is started on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the way to salvation through the courteous treatment
he receives from some older and much respected
person. Simply to treat him as if he were a dignified
young gentleman amounts to inciting him to put
forth his greatest effort to make a show of manliness.
A close student of young nature will often
observe that merely to address such a youth as
&#8220;Mister&#8221; So-and-So causes him to straighten up
and try to look the part.</p>

<p>The hostess and guide at the rural party of young
people will err not a little if she feels under the
necessity of preparing a banquet or even a heavy
luncheon for the occasion. Something as simple as a
light drink and a wafer or two will be quite enough.
The object of the refreshments is not merely to feed
the young people to the point of stupefaction, but
rather to give physical tone to support the vivacity
of all.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What about the country dance</span></h4>

<p>Unless the country dance can be radically reformed,
it must be very strongly advised against. There is
something about this occasion as usually conducted
which seems to invite coarse characters and disreputable
conduct. The country dance has so often
been the scene of vice, drunkenness, and other such
evils as to have received a permanent stigma of
cheapness. The only seeming possibility of making a
success of it is by the method of inviting a very
exclusive set to attend, and this thing is so suggestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of aristocracy and snobbishness as to cause not a
little ill feeling in the neighborhood. Under present
conditions the country dance cannot be so managed
as to make it contribute to the social and moral uplift
of country young people. There are many better
forms of entertainment which may be substituted
for it.</p>

<p>Along with the country dance should be rated the
cheap professional entertainments that are so often
given in the country school houses. Many of these
are not only degrading but are morally evil in their
suggestions, while they tend to give the young a
depraved taste in respect to public shows and
theaters. The school trustees may well exclude all
such &#8220;shows&#8221; from the building.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Additional forms of entertainment</span></h4>

<p>The farm parents most desirous of leading in the
young people&#8217;s entertainments, and best fitted to do
so, may find it impracticable to invite the young into
their home. In such case, there are several other
ways whereby the desired ends may be achieved.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXIV.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="Fig_31" name="Fig_31"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxiv.png" width="600" height="286" alt="" title="Plate XXIV" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 31.&mdash;A rural scene in Canada, where the church and the school are situated together. The large barn
in the background is significant. Much of the daily thought and conversation is centered here.</span>
</div>

<p>1. <i>The social hour at the religious services.</i>&mdash;It
is deemed quite advisable that those who plan the
religious service in the country have thought of a
social hour in connection therewith. The latter
may prove fully as helpful in a constructive sense as
the former, and it can in no wise detract from the
value of the religious meeting. This combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>of events is already being successfully tried in a
number of places. For example, at the mid-week
evening service, there is given first an hour to the
prayer meeting or the discussion of the religious topics
and the church work. After that, the scene is
changed into one of clean, wholesome amusement
with the special thought of giving the young people
social entertainment and training. It has been
found that this very method of uniting the religious
and social service under a carefully planned program
sometimes more than doubles the attendance. Of
course the first essential for the success of such a
meeting is that an able leader be in charge of it.</p>

<p>2. <i>A country literary society.</i>&mdash;In times gone
by the country literary society has played a mighty
part indirectly in the building of the nation. Many
a statesman or leader of the people has received his
first aid and inspiration at the little old country
&#8220;literary and debating society.&#8221; There is no good
reason why this same general form of society might
not continue to do its effective work. However, in
its best form, there will be some additions to the old
procedure of merely debating the important public
questions. The program makers may well have in
mind the ideal of bringing out every form of talent
latent among the young of the community. It is
especially advisable that every young attendant be
given an invitation to do the part of which he is most
capable, and that he be urged to do it. It is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
possible to arrange a program upon which only the
ablest and most capable young persons of the neighborhood
may appear. But such would be a violation
of the best purpose of the society; namely, not
merely to provide a first-class entertainment, but an
entertainment <i>which shall bring out the greatest possible
variety of talent and awaken interest and enthusiasm
on the part of every member</i>.</p>

<p>Then, let the motto of the ideal country literary
society be, &#8220;Something worth while for every member
to do.&#8221; The old-fashioned country society, like
the older public school, was too narrow. It touched
life and awakened interests in only a few places. The
old school tested a boy in the three R&#8217;s and geography.
If he did well in these, he was &#8220;smart.&#8221; If he failed
in the traditional subjects, he was branded as a
dullard and crowded out of the school, although in
respect to some other untested activities he may have
been a slumbering genius. So with the primitive
&#8220;literary and debating society&#8221;; debating and
&#8220;speaking pieces&#8221; were practically the only numbers
on the program and usually only the ablest were
allowed to appear. Ordinary talent in debating
and reciting and all manner of promising talent in
other lines was allowed to slumber on in the lives of
many of the young people in attendance. Now, it
is practically a certainty that every member of the
young literary society can perform a part very acceptably,
provided the discerning leader know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
that part is. And best of all, the bringing out of such
talent means the awakening of many other splendid
interests among the youthful members of the community,
and finally the development of moral courage
and other forms of manliness and womanliness.</p>

<p>Now, to come to the point of a social result, the
so-called literary entertainment can easily be made
up in two parts, the literary and the social; and there
should be set apart an hour for the latter.</p>

<p>3. <i>The social side of the economic clubs.</i>&mdash;In
many instances, there will be organized boys&#8217; corn-raising
or crop-improvement clubs, and with them
country clubs of the girls interested in household
economy. These club meetings may be made the
occasion of not a little social improvement. The
boys and girls may meet at the same hour and place,
and after the business has been disposed of there
may be a coming together in a social way. Such
arrangement is highly advisable for two reasons.
First, it will certainly increase the membership of
the clubs; and, second, the social instincts of the
young people may be suitably indulged.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Some concluding suggestions</span></h4>

<p>The leader interested in the foregoing plans may
again be reminded of the necessity of instituting a
social organization of such a nature as to touch all
the young lives in the neighborhood. The rules
and regulations governing the society should there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>fore
be drawn on broad and liberal lines, not forgetting
the great possibilities of awakening slumbering
interests and aptitudes, and of building up a social
community that will draw young people to it.</p>

<p>If one will take the time to drive for a hundred
miles in a direct line through the farm districts, as the
author has done, he will be not a little surprised at the
striking contrast in the social conditions of the various
neighborhoods passed through. In one instance he
will be told that there is absolutely nothing present
to invite the young&mdash;a dull, dead place with perhaps
many run-down farms and farm homes to keep
it company. He will learn that the young people
of such a community are running off to some neighboring
town where many of them find a cheap and
degrading class of entertainment. But the next
adjoining neighborhood may present a converse situation.
One will be told that the young people
are happy and contented there, that they have frequent
meetings of their social clubs and other forms
of organization; most probably the appearance of
the neighborhood will be likewise much better than
that of the other one mentioned. Attractive homes,
well-kept roads and hedges, and other evidences of
prosperity will meet one&#8217;s view.</p>

<p>In one district visited, the author found that this
better situation had an interesting history and that
it was nearly all traceable to a quarter of a century
of public-spiritedness of one man. This resident had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
settled upon a quarter section of good land. While
he was reconstructing his own home and its surroundings
into a place of attractiveness, he was
continually engaged in awakening the entire neighborhood
in behalf of better things. He had led out
in establishing a well-attended Sunday school in the
district, had been instrumental in instituting regular
preaching service there twice each month, had
led the entire neighborhood out on more than one
occasion for a day&#8217;s work in improving and beautifying
the school grounds, had been the organizer and
director of the country literary society, and of more
than one club of farmers and their wives. During
all this time he was correspondent for one or two
county papers and used every occasion for advertising
the home community. All together, it was a
most commendable and far-reaching service which
this one man performed for his own neighborhood.
So, it may be said that wherever there is one inspired
leader in a country community, there is life.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be urged that the biggest thing in
the rural community is not the big crop of corn or
wheat or the excellent breeds of live stock. Important
as these things are, the great concern of the
community should be the development of sterling
character in the lives of the growing boys and girls
and the cleanness and integrity of the personalities
of every one within the neighborhood limits. To
that end let this social center ideal be actualized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
becoming a place toward which the thoughts of all
will go frequently and fondly during the hours of
care and toil. Let it be made a place the thought of
which will forever impart a full measure of good
cheer, of contentment, and of honest courage to the
mind of every member of the society thereabout.
Let it be a place so ordered and arranged that things
sacred and divine may reach down to the things
often thought of as very commonplace and mean,
and exalt the latter to their true and proper place.
Lastly, let it be earnestly desired and planned for
that every heart in the rural district shall be rekindled
with a living fire of enthusiasm in behalf of the general
improvement&mdash;of interest in the things that are
high and divine, and of affection and good will toward
all in the community. Let some local resident rise
up as leader and bring this order of things to pass, and
the social experiences of the young people will naturally
become of such a nature as to develop them into
men and women of great worth and efficiency.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<br />
<i>THE FARM BOY&#8217;S INTEREST IN THE
BUSINESS</i></h3>


<p>The theory that the boys and girls who grow up in
the country must in time become settled in farm
homes of their own has neither logic nor psychology
nor common sense to support it. It is never a question
of whether or not a boy will take up the work of
his father, but whether or not he will find at length
the true and only calling for which his nature is best
fitted. If the parents of the country boy will keep
the latter question clearly in mind, many a problem
in the latter&#8217;s rearing will be made much easier.</p>

<p>In order to break the monotony of the style of
expression, much of this chapter will be addressed
somewhat directly to the father of the country boy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What is in your boy?</span></h4>

<p>If a man should come suddenly into possession of a
piece of land having a productive soil, one of his first
questions in regard to the soil would be, What will it
best grow? Farmers blundered and starved along
for generations in an attempt to make a first-class
farm produce the wrong crops, or to produce the right
crop through the wrong manner of treatment; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
this simply because they used methods of tradition
and guess rather than those of science.</p>

<p>Now apply the foregoing situation to the boy problem,
if you will. So long as we attempt to secure
from him the wrong results and deal with him by
wrong methods, we are likely to conclude that there
is &#8220;nothing in him.&#8221; Therefore, in order to act
intelligently and helpfully in the matter of giving the
young son a business relation to farm life, it is first
necessary to determine, as far as may be possible,
the bent of his mind, remembering that the great
artist, the great writer, or the great captain of industry
is just as likely to be born in the country home as
elsewhere. In fact, we shall learn in time, much to
our advantage, that there must be a careful sifting
process which will result in sending some of the
country-bred young men directly to their important
places in the city, and some of the city-bred youths
to the rural industries.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Much experimentation necessary</span></h4>

<p>The one who undertakes to develop a boy&#8217;s interest
in business affairs has really before him a problem
in experimental psychology. Many of the youth&#8217;s
best aptitudes are necessarily still slumbering and
unknown to either himself or others. The fundamental
steps preparatory for a successful commercial
venture on the part of a young man are comparatively
few but none of them can safely be
omitted. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>1. <i>Willingness to work.</i>&mdash;In this connection, perhaps
something will be recalled from <a href="#Page_129">Chapter IX</a>.
We may at least be reminded of the difference in the
attitude of mind of the boy who regards labor as a
painful necessity and the one who enjoys a willingness
to work. So long as the youth feels as if he
were driven to his tasks there is little hope of arousing
his interest in the business side of it. His mind
will continue too much on the problem of avoiding
work and on ways and means by which to get something
for nothing.</p>

<p>There is probably a period of dishonesty in the life
of every normal youth. Following the dawn of
adolescence there is a great wave of new interest and
new meaning coming to him out of the business and
social world. The world is so full of interesting
enticements. Everything looks to be good and
within easy reach. He is especially prone to accept
material things at their advertised value. He spends
his dimes for prize boxes thought to contain gold rings
and other such finery. His quarters and half dollars
frequently go in payment for the &#8220;valuable&#8221; things
offered &#8220;free for the price of the transportation,&#8221;
the purpose of this tempting gift being &#8220;simply for
the sake of introducing the goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it is well to see the boy safe through this period
of allurement. So long as the world seems to hold
out so many highly valued things which may be had
for a trifle the youth will see little need of his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>ing
to obtain them. So, attend him in his efforts
to get something for nothing. Permit him to be
stung a few times and thus teach him how and where
to look for the sting. Finally, impress him with the
thought that every material thing worth while represents
the price of somebody&#8217;s honest labor. At length
he will see the reasonableness of industry and settle
down with a purpose of making his way through life
by means of honest endeavor. You now have the
youth so far on his way to successful business undertaking.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ability to save.</i>&mdash;All healthy boys are naturally
inclined to be spendthrifts. Saving a part of one&#8217;s
means is a fine art acquired only through judicious
practice. It is assumed that the young son is being
reasonably paid for certain required tasks. So the
next duty is to see that he saves a part of his earnings.
For the purpose of this training in saving, a
toy bank may be procured; or he may be directed in
depositing a small weekly sum in a penny savings
bank. Still another way is to teach him to keep a
book account of his earnings, giving him due-bills
for the amounts withheld from his wages.</p>

<p>There is one small business practice, the importance
of which for the boy is too frequently overlooked;
that is, the practice of carrying a small amount of
change in his pocket. He must learn to use his
money thoughtfully and not merely on every occasion
of his being allowed to have it. He must acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the habit of self-restraint in the use of money. To do
this is to learn to spend judiciously. To have reached
this stage of financial training is a sufficient guarantee
that the youth is proceeding well on his way toward
success in business enterprise.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Start on a small scale</span></h4>

<p>Then, give your growing son as wide a variety of
experience in work and in watching business affairs
as the situation will permit of. During the process of
this mental growth help him to make a small investment
in something that will grow and increase under
his intelligent care. Let us assume that your specialty
is a certain strain of corn or a certain breed
of cattle. If the boy shows an interest in this matter,
start him in at an early age, say ten to fourteen,
on his own account. Give him in exchange for his
work a small plot of ground on which to grow corn,
perhaps with a view to his later entering the boys&#8217;
contest for a prize. Or, help him to get a small
beginning in the cattle business.</p>

<p>But in case the lad shows no interest in your business,
do not let the matter seriously trouble you for a
moment. Simply continue to give him his general
education, including the best school course available
and a training in the performance of work as well as
the judicious use of the spending money that may
come into his hands. Careful study of the boy may
indicate to you that his aptitude for business runs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the direction of something to which you are giving
little or no attention but to which you may in time
bring him.</p>

<p>There is the case of a successful wheat raiser who
discovered his son&#8217;s fondness for thoroughbred cattle.
So the boy was carefully started on a small scale in
the business of raising short-horns. To-day that
son is known far and wide as an able specialist in this
line of stock breeding. Now, if the father in this
case had done as thousands of other farmers are still
doing; namely, if he had attempted to force the boy,
against the latter&#8217;s natural inclination, to take up
wheat raising or any other undesirable business,
then, the son would have most probably skipped off
for the city and secured a fourth-rate place for the
mere wages it would bring. Some day this tragic,
oft-repeated story of mismanagement and misdirection
of the growing boy will come out in all its
distressing details.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Give your son a square deal</span></h4>

<p>Deal with your young son on business principles
from the beginning. Do not hastily and unwisely
give him a piece of property that will have to be
taken from him in the future because of its having
grown into a disproportionate value. This old form
of mistreatment of the country boy has been the means
of thwarting the business integrity of many a promising
youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>If the boy&#8217;s small beginning develops under his
care into a business of large proportions, the only
check or hindrance that the ethics of the case will
allow is that you treat with him on fair business terms,
just as you would with any good business man.
You may cause him to bear all his own personal expenses
and all the expense connected with the care
and development of his live stock or crop. Then the
matter of curtailing him must stop. And if the son
soon becomes able to buy you out, it is certainly an
affair to be proud of, not a thing to hinder by unfair
means.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Keep the boy&#8217;s perfect good will</span></h4>

<p>It is a serious matter to lose the boy&#8217;s confidence
or in any way break faith with him, even though
there be nothing about the place in which you can
make him take a business interest. As he grows to
maturity his own inner nature must gradually guide
him into the way of a calling&mdash;and a divine calling
at that it may prove to be. It may not seem out
of place to quote the words of a religious teacher who
says: &#8220;Do you not know that if one&#8217;s inner nature
points out clearly and inspiringly what he should
undertake for a life work, such thing may be regarded
as the Voice of the Divine One speaking faithfully
through the instrumentality of one of his own creatures?&#8221;</p>

<p>So it may prove at length that you will have to sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a load of corn in order to set up in the garret of your
house a miniature art studio of some kind for your
young son. Or, perhaps you may have to establish a
small machine shop as an adjunct to the barn or wood
shed, wherein the budding genius may blossom into
that beauty of manly power and efficiency which all
the world is glad to admire. Out of just such a wise
indulgence as that last named a certain Kansas boy
finally became enabled to revolutionize the old farm
home and the work done there through the installation
of an excellent motor power plant. Electric
light for the house and barn, power for operating
feed grinder, washing machine, grindstone, fanning
mill, and many other such machines&mdash;all this has
resulted from the rightly directed work of a youth
who could have easily been driven to the city into
some treadmill of mere wage earning.</p>

<p>But, occasionally the boy will prove himself a
versatile character, succeeding in a measure in every
line of small business to which you introduce him,
yet showing a marked success in none. In such case
the advisable thing to do is to continue his general
education for a longer period than is necessary for
the boy who shows an early inclination toward a
given line of work.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Some will be retained on the farm</span></h4>

<p>It is admittedly desirable, all things fairly considered,
that many of the very best boys remain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the farm and help develop rural life into what it
should be. Hence the necessity of finding a way to
interest such boys in some of the many business
affairs connected with the farm home. Perhaps there
is no better way to develop the lad&#8217;s interest in the
affairs of the place than that of allowing him to
participate in the practical business transactions as
the conditions may allow. Let the parents take him
to the store, the bank, and other such places for the
benefit of his experience. Send him in with the
produce with authority to sell and to invest a part
of the proceeds in whatever the family may need.
The father should have the boy with him when selecting
and buying machinery or live stock at public
sales. Send him to the bank with checks or drafts
to be deposited or collected. Give him an opportunity
to keep the family accounts, or at least to
keep his own recorded in a book.</p>

<p>The ordinary farmer can think of more ways than
the foregoing whereby to give his growing son the
needed experience in money matters. The best result
of such practice is that if there be anything in
connection with the affairs of the farm in which the
boy will have a native interest this aptitude will be
discovered; and it can then be made the basis of the
young man&#8217;s introduction into a successful participation
in some practical business. The boy&#8217;s permanent
calling is seriously involved in this discussion.
On page 279 of this book will be found a description
of three methods of vocational training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The awakening often comes from without</span></h4>

<p>Parents who find it difficult to arouse the farm
boy&#8217;s interest in any part of the home business may
sometimes easily secure the desired result by sending
the youth away on a trip to the county fair or
other such place. As a means of stimulating boys
in respect to some kind of productive home industry
the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College
instituted a school of agriculture for country youths
at the state fair. Each organized farmers&#8217; institute
and each county superintendent was asked to send
one boy. A large tent was furnished by the college.
This served for a lecture and display room during
the day and a boys&#8217; sleeping room during the night.</p>

<p>At the first session 122 boys attended, coming
from 57 counties. The lectures covered such subjects
as farm crops, veterinary science, track and field
athletics. The displays at the fair were used for
illustrative matter. So far the results of the school
have been reported most favorable. An increasing
number of boys throughout the state are making
preparation for it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">An awakening in the south</span></h4>

<p>It is most encouraging to observe the changing
ideals of business and industry now in progress
throughout the nation. The many vocational-training
schools and the increasing attendance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
mechanical and industrial colleges bear witness of
this fact. The American Negro, ever a faithful
laborer, is now being taught in such institutions as
Tuskegee and Hampton, not only to perform some
honest work well but also to plan and prepare for a
business of his own.</p>

<p>The son of the southern planter is becoming more
and more imbued with the new spirit of efficiency
through personal industry. On this matter a member
of the faculty of the Louisiana Agricultural and
Mechanical College says: &#8220;It is a mistake to think
that the best of the country youth of the south are
continuing in the old-fashioned ideal of becoming
mere gentlemen of culture and leisure. In 1910 there
were nearly 50,000 boys living in a dozen of the
southern states, who astonished the entire country
with their achievements in corn-raising. They
ranged in age from fifteen to eighteen years. At the
national exhibit held in Columbus, Ohio, one hundred
of them showed an average yield of 134 bushels of
corn to the acre. This corn-growing practice is under
the direction of the national government, and is more
than a big, exciting contest, it is a splendid course in
rural home education.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXV.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 32.&mdash;A group of &#8220;coming&#8221; Kansans. Every boy pictured here carried away some sort of
prize at a state corn show.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We have at this college hundreds of young men
from the plantations and they are intensely interested
in working out the industrial problems that pertain
to their own home affairs. I have been surprised at
their eagerness to get into the soil and to do the me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>chanical
work connected with their studies. All over
the south there seems to be an awakening among the
boys and young men, of an interest in the industrial
and commercial problems of the plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farm papers and the educational magazines in
the southern states give much evidence of this same
sort of awakening. The farmers&#8217; and planters&#8217;
organizations, the local improvement and school
betterment clubs, and many other movements, are
giving both incentive and direction to the country
youths who are at all inclined to find an interest in
the home affairs. The rural parents who desire outside
aid in arousing their boys&#8217; interest in the home
business may well seek such assistance by bringing
the latter into closer touch with one of these progressive
organizations.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Partnership between father and son</span></h4>

<p>After the farmer&#8217;s son has fully settled upon his
father&#8217;s business as an ideal one for himself, there
may be brought to the latter a gradual relief from
the worry of details, and that through a partnership
management. A. G. Hulting, Jr., of Geneseo,
Illinois, thus describes such a plan of co&#246;peration
in a letter to Arthur J. Bill, the agricultural
writer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have 160 acres of land in the farm. My
father owns the land. I do the work, provide all the
labor, horses, and machinery, and we have an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
interest in the live stock and we share equally in the
net returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other terms of co&#246;peration have proved successful.
In many cases, the son rents all or a part of the place
on terms similar to those allowed the outside renter;
excepting that he is usually given the advantages of
free board and the use of the home conveniences.
In all such business transactions between father and
son it is highly advisable that the contract be carefully
drawn in writing. The verbal contract is proverbially
a trouble maker, and that even among relatives.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Summary and concluding suggestions</span></h4>

<p>1. Not nearly all promising youths can be encouraged
to take a vital interest in the father&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>2. In case the boy cannot be induced to take a
permanent interest in anything on the home farm,
he may at least have much practice in the transaction
of the small business connected therewith.</p>

<p>3. The ability to work willingly, the ideal that an
honest living is to be earned through personal effort,
and the practice of saving a part of the weekly or
monthly earnings&mdash;these will give any boy an excellent
start on the road to success and affluence.</p>

<p>4. Deal with the young son on business principles
from the first, seeing that he shares reasonably in
the losses as well as in the gains. Although his
interest in any chosen line of work may not become
vital till he makes some money out of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
hold him persistently in line during the &#8220;lean&#8221;
years and thus allow him to learn the excellent
lessons of failure.</p>

<p>5. It may prove unfair to the members of the
family to permit one of the sons to secure control of
the business of the home farm. Some pathetic instances
of this kind have really occurred. For the
sake of the peace and well-being of all, such an occurrence
must be prevented by careful forethought.</p>

<p>6. On the other hand, in case where the boy has
started with a scrawny pig or through renting a piece
of the home place, and, after dealing fair and square
with all, has come into possession of considerable
property of his own, do not wrest it from him or in
any way take advantage of his minority. Such a
youth will in time most probably reflect high credit
upon the family.</p>

<p>7. Finally, the farm parent needs to be warned
against the possibility of developing his son into a
mere money-maker. Such is a poor standard of
success. The man whose only aim in life is merely to
prosper financially is a poor citizen of any community.
Teach the boy to succeed in his business ventures,
but at the same time imbue him with the
thought that his money wealth must be regarded as
so much opportunity to help build up the community,
the state, and the nation. Teach him that financial
success is worthy of the name only when it is
linked with social efficiency.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
<i>BUSINESS TRAINING FOR THE COUNTRY
GIRL</i></h3>


<p>During a two-hour ride on a railway train the
author had as a seat companion a sixty-year-old
farmer and stock raiser, whose specialty was that of
raising mules for the market. And what of definite
information this good husbandman possessed about
the long-eared beast of burden would fill a volume of
considerable size. He knew just what time of year
the mule should be foaled, when weaned, when broken
to the halter and to work; how to feed and groom a
mule in order to get the best physical growth; how
to train the animal so as to develop all the latent good
qualities and repress the bad ones.</p>

<p>After the natural life history of the faithful mule
had been carefully reviewed by the rural companion
the conversation was turned to the subject of girls.
Had he a daughter? &#8220;Yes, twenty-two years old.&#8221;
What did she know about money and the common
affairs of business? &#8220;Business! Mighty little any
woman knows about business,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We buy our
girl what she needs and have put her through the
town high school. I expect her to get married some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>time.
Her mother has taught her how to do housework.&#8221;
Further than that the father seemed to
know very little about his daughter, and he showed
plainly that he did not consider this second topic
of conversation half so interesting as the first one.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Is the country girl neglected?</span></h4>

<p>Inquiry will prove that the foregoing case of
parental ignorance and indifference about the daughter
is all too common, especially the ignorance. It
seems never to have occurred to many parents who
have growing daughters that unless the young
woman have a fair amount of knowledge of the value
and use of money her future happiness and well-being
and that of her family are in danger of becoming
seriously jeopardized. It is a singular and yet
lamentable fact that so many American parents,&mdash;parents
too who are intensely desirous that their
growing children have the best possible moral and
religious teaching&mdash;that these same good parents
fail to understand how one of the very foundation
stones of efficient moral and religious life is constituted
of a definite body of knowledge of common
business affairs. They do not seem to realize that
the young man or the young woman who knows
from experience just how money is earned, and how
it may be judiciously expended and profitably invested,
is far on the way to a high plane of moral and
religious living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>However, there is probably no place of greater
opportunities for developing sober judgment in the
growing girl than that afforded by the ordinary
farm home. For here the business management of
the household and of the farm affairs are practically
merged. There is the further advantage of a considerable
variety of ways whereby the daughter may
be remunerated for what she does. But, how may we
best interpret this question? First of all, what in a
practical sense is a satisfactory business training for a
young woman, a farmer&#8217;s daughter in particular?
Do we desire that she become a shrewd money-maker
and successful a some sort of commercial life? Few
would take such a position. But in order that
the young woman may be fully prepared to fill her
heaven-ordained place as the center and source of
love and influence in a family, we must provide that
she be given just such instruction in the use of money
as will enable her to occupy her high position with
the greatest possible success.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Why the girl leaves the farm</span></h4>

<p>Under the title above the Farmer&#8217;s Voice prints
portions of two letters which help to throw not a
little light on this much-neglected subject. Miss
Alta Hooper writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one great cry going out from the people, and
one also much in need of an answer, is &#8216;how to keep
the boy on the farm.&#8217; It is very seldom that the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the farm is alluded to, although it may be that
she is included, in a general way, in the great amount
of literature concerning her brother. But, take it
from the farmer girl that she is a live one, and unless
money is coming into her pockets, unless she is
comparatively independent and has some interest
to keep her awake, she isn&#8217;t going to &#8216;stay put,&#8217; but
will get out where she can earn some money of her
very own, to buy the little things so dear to the hearts
of girls; and she will not be questioned and lectured
and scolded over every little expenditure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the girls on the farm have minds and pride
and ambition just as big as their brothers&#8217; too; and
in many cases they are not given half a chance to
realize one iota of this ambition. It is then that a
career off the farm and away from the farm home
appeals to them. Then the thought comes that even
though the salary to be earned may be small, still it
is all one&#8217;s own, and there is no fear in planning
where and in what it shall be invested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Likewise, Mrs. F. L. Stevens, writing for <i>Progressive
Farmer</i>, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How often have we seen young girls leaving comfortable
farm homes to go into typewriting, clerking,
or bookkeeping, in order to have their own money.
An allowance for personal expenses in the beginning
would have solved this problem. But the father has
not seen it that way.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVI.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="Fig_33" name="Fig_33"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxvi.png" width="600" height="451" alt="" title="Plate XXVI" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 33.&mdash;At a tender age girls are instinctively fond of doing such work as is displayed here.
Strange to say, some mothers deny their little daughters the character-forming benefits
of this childish occupation.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is not necessary that the daughter be given a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>monthly or yearly allowance of so much cash, but
the really better way, it would seem, would be to
start her in some special branch of work, say, poultry-raising.
Or perhaps she might be given a cow
or a horse or a pig, which would in time bring in
sums of money by careful management; and the
business, a small one perhaps in the beginning,
would easily develop. Many young girls like to
work in a garden as the produce is always a good
source of income and an interesting and educational
work.&#8221;</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Certain rules to be observed</span></h4>

<p>If we are to give up the idea that the young woman
naturally possesses the necessary business judgment,
and to substitute the better idea that she must be
taught how to manage her own affairs; then, What
are the fundamental steps necessary to impart such
instruction? It seems to the author that they are
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Teach the girl to work.</i>&mdash;As was shown in
a previous chapter, the girl must be taught carefully
and conscientiously how to work. Even
though she may be so fortunate&mdash;or unfortunate&mdash;as
not to be compelled to do any of her own housework,
only a first-hand knowledge of how such work
goes on will enable her successfully to direct it.
The strength of our democracy is much dependent
upon the character of our women. The modern tendency
toward the development of a leisure class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
among the women and girls of the wealthier families
is quite as much a menace to social solidarity as
was the older order of keeping women in ignorance
and servitude.</p>

<p>The problem of household help is much intensified
because of the disfavor with which the so-called
better classes of women look upon the vocation of
the domestic employee. The necessary inequality
of rank of the home mistress and her employees is
more a matter of tradition and imagination than
of reality. The social inequality which follows and
which drives many young women into less advantageous
places of employment will disappear just
as soon as all growing girls are conducted through
a carefully planned course of work and household
industry. No farm parents can afford to deny the
daughter the excellent disciplinary results of careful
training in the performance of every ordinary household
duty.</p>

<p>2. <i>Teach her business sense.</i>&mdash;In cases where the
growing boy or girl is simply given spending money
for the asking&mdash;or the begging&mdash;there results a
perverted idea of the meaning of money. A girl so
trained during her youthful years is inclined to take
this same attitude toward her husband in the future.
That is, she will probably regard it as necessary to
beg for an allowance and deem it right and proper
to spend all she can obtain in this way. The seriousness
of such relations between man and wife is easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
seen. But the growing girl can be taught that money
is merely a convenient unit of measurement of values
which are produced chiefly by means of work.</p>

<p>Advanced students of our social life are putting
forth much effort to solve the divorce problem.
In their efforts to determine causes and to provide
cures for divorce, some of them have gone so far
as to advocate a school for matrimony, one of the ends
being that of preventing incompatible persons from
entering into the life union. Among the causes
contributing to the divorce evil have been the radically
different ideals of the use of money on the part
of the contracting pair. An attorney of long standing
experience with divorce cases says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule the woman who alleges non-support in
her petition for divorce reveals the fact, before the
case is ended, that she is lacking in the proper idea
of the use of money, is often especially weak in
knowledge of how the family income should be
spent if the family affairs are to go on satisfactorily.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. <i>Train her to transact personal business.</i>&mdash;Then,
begin early in her life to teach the girl to
transact business affairs that relate to her personal
interests and to the home life of women. Do not
buy all the little articles necessary for her, but allow
her, with money reasonably provided, to make her
own minor purchases under your advice and direction.
The intelligent farmer knows somewhat definitely
what his yearly income and outlay are. Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
not his daughter be told how these accounts run,
in the usual year, and she then be asked to keep an
account of all her own personal affairs for a year?
Such required practice will do more than all the
arithmetic lessons in the schools to inculcate an
intimate knowledge of the value of money in relation
to her own affairs&mdash;to say nothing of the good
business judgment likely to be acquired.</p>

<p>Thus the country girl may receive a better business
training than her city cousin whose nearness to the
attractive stores and shops proves a constant incentive
for over-indulgence and wastefulness in the
use of money.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Make her the family accountant.</span>&mdash;As soon
as she becomes old enough, take the daughter into
your confidence as regards the family expense
account. Make her acquainted with the items of
income and expenditure in detail. And also make it
appear to her that the business of the home is not
being conducted satisfactorily unless some portion
of the income be set aside for the emergencies of the
future.</p>

<p>At this point there is offered an opportunity to
give the daughter some much-needed business
training. There is much being said of late by way of
urging the farmer to keep an accurate book account
of all his transactions. Out of the experiment
stations have come published letters and bulletins
urging that such things be done and showing methods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
But the evidence goes to show that the majority of
farmers do not find time for it. So it will in many
cases be found practicable to turn this important
task of bookkeeping over to the growing daughter.
Among the many benefits to be derived will be
the excellent business training it will furnish her.
As a diversion from the common household duties
the accounting will prove most refreshing. And,
then, the farmer will soon find this service to the
farm business so important as to justify him in
paying his daughter reasonably for the work.</p>

<p>5. <i>Miserliness to be avoided.</i>&mdash;While the habits
of a spendthrift are perhaps above all things else to
be avoided, a close second to this as an evil practice
is the habit of expending in a miserly and begrudging
manner. So, teach the girl to give her money
willingly for all the ordinary necessities and comforts
of life and for such luxuries as the conditions will
reasonably warrant.</p>

<p>The far-sighted parent and the one really interested
in the future of his daughter will readily observe
how much enslaved adults finally become in the
use of money. There are perhaps as many well-to-do
persons who are miserly because they cannot help
it as there are improvident persons who are spendthrifts
because they cannot longer prevent it. Both
classes manifest the certain results of training and
habit. In his interesting chapter on the psychology
of habit Professor James explains so aptly how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
man, long practiced in enforced economy, but at
length having ample means, goes to the store with
the determination of paying liberally for an article;
and how he finally comes away with something
cheap.</p>

<p>A &#8220;golden mean&#8221; is therefore to be sought in
training the girl in the use of money. Not how to
save at all hazards, but how to spend judiciously,
with conscious thought of the right relation between
income and outlay&mdash;this is perhaps the more
acceptable ideal.</p>

<p>6. <i>Teach her to give.</i>&mdash;While inculcating business
ideas into the mind of your growing daughter,
guard against her acquiring a mere passion for money-making
and the accumulation of wealth. For
example, one of the best means of achieving this end
would be to see that she gives a part of her earnings
to some worthy cause or other. Explain to her
again and again that she must keep up in her life a
sort of equipoise of receiving and giving, if the highest
sense of inner satisfaction is always to be her portion.</p>

<p>The young must learn sooner or later that there is
other than a money profit to be derived from the
investment of money. Accordingly, it will not be
found difficult for the rural parents to point out to
their daughter some place merely where she may
invest a small part of her earnings in human welfare.
An orphan child living in the neighborhood may be
sorely in need of a new dress or school books, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
lonely and aged widow may be cheered by the gift of
a wall picture, a crippled child may be accumulating
funds for hospital treatment, or another person may
have lost heavily from flood or fire. These and
many more like them may be made the occasion of
teaching the girl a beautiful lesson of sympathy and
sacrifice. And the sacrifice should come out of
what she has accumulated through her own small
business enterprise.</p>

<p>7. <i>Teach the meaning of a contract.</i>&mdash;It is
often declared that women fail to appreciate the
obligations of a contract, that they will enter into a
strict agreement to buy an article or to pay for
another and then refuse to carry out such agreement.
Merchants have been so often called on to
deal with this feminine change of mind that they
have seen fit to establish a custom of taking back at
cost any article not found satisfactory upon trial.
This failure of women to adhere strictly to the terms
of an agreement has given currency to the opinion
that they are naturally dishonest. Weininger in
his volume &#8220;Sex and Character&#8221; even offers a line
of questionable proof to confirm the correctness of
the opinion.</p>

<p>But Dr. G. Stanley Hall in many of his researches
shows that falsehood and deception are common
and natural practices among ordinary children. All
forms of honest and fair moral and business practice
are less natural than acquired. They must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
actual experience, and much of it, as a basis for their
becoming a permanent part of character. Hence,
the so-called dishonesty of women in relation to the
obligations of a business agreement&mdash;that is probably
nothing more than a matter of sheer ignorance.
Farm girls are proverbially lacking in business
practice and in knowledge of the rights and obligations
of a contract. It is obligatory upon their
parents to remove such ignorance through business
training.</p>

<p>8. <i>Prepare her to deal with grafters.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The
majority of his victims were women,&#8221; is the statement
so often read in connection with the fraudulent
schemes of the exposed money shark. Millions of
dollars are annually taken from credulous women by
the get-rich-quick money trader. This polite form
of theft has become so flagrant as to necessitate
much vigilance and many prosecutions on the part of
the national government. Widows and other dependent
women are especially the sufferers.</p>

<p>The necessity of preparing the innocent young
woman to deal with the enticing business fraud is
very apparent. Two or three matters must especially
be attended to in giving the required instruction.
First, take advantage of many occasions
to explain to the girl just how a given case is being
worked, so that she may be on guard against such
allurements; second, it is well to advise the untrained
young woman against investing in any scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of profit sharing that offers above a good current
rate of interest.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Should there be an actual investment?</span></h4>

<p>Then, what if anything should be done in the
ordinary farm home by way of providing an investment
for the growing daughter so that she may daily
have some practice in business affairs, as well as an
income for use in meeting her personal expenses?
Before attempting to answer this question, let us
be certain that we have the correct point of view of
the growing daughter&#8217;s ideal relation to the practical
affairs in the rural home. It seems to the
author that there is only one safe rule of procedure
here and that is, whatever the investment,&mdash;if
there be any at all,&mdash;it must be understood that
the ideal is one of developing the girl into a beautiful
womanhood and not one of making the investment
pay in the mere money sense of the term. In other
words, the business of the farm and the farm home
must serve directly the highest interests of the members
of the household, even though money accumulations
cannot, as a result, go on quite so fast. Or, as
we have put it several times before: The farm and
the live stock and all that pertains thereto must be so
managed as to contribute directly to the development
of the high aspects of character in the boys and girls,
and not as materials which the growing boys and girls
are to help build up and multiply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>Now, if it still be insisted upon that the country
girl have a definite business relation to the affairs of
the home, there are two or three ways whereby this
may be accomplished. One method is to give the
girl a fixed and reasonable sum of money for whatever
she may do by way of helping in the house. Another
is that of providing a small investment in something
that may be expected to increase reasonably in
value and finally bring her a money return. Of the
two methods of procedure mentioned, it would seem
that the first is the more desirable. If the daughter
be given an interest in anything like the live stock
or some farm crop, the thing will not appeal to her
directly, and whatever interest she may have in it
will be a purely borrowed one. On the other hand,
if she be given a generous allowance for her services,
and during the younger years be trained in the expenditure
of this allowance, good results may be expected.
Similarly as with the boy, the growing girl must be
taught to look toward the future. A system of restraints
must be placed against her tendency to
squander her small income, and gradually she may be
trained to set aside a small portion of what she has
with a view to its being applied upon something of
her own later in life. It is perhaps too much to ask
the girl to save enough money to pay her way through
college, but there are many advantages in training
her to save for a certain portion of that expense.
Perhaps she may be able to buy her own clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>It is not reasonable to assume that every well-trained
country girl will find it advisable to take a
college course. So, instead of saving up for college
expenses, she may be taught to lay by something for
the day of her marriage and with the thought of
helping equip a home of her own. As a matter of
fact, it is not a question of the specific purpose for
which the money may be set apart. The main
issue is that of staying by her day after day and week
after week, and guiding and advising her until she
finally acquires good sense, mature judgment,
and self-reliance in regard to the business affairs
that may be expected to constitute a part of her
life as a keeper of a home of her own.</p>

<p><i>How the southern girls earn money.</i>&mdash;One of the
most interesting and significant modern movements
in behalf of juvenile industry is that of the Southern
Girls&#8217; Tomato Clubs, originated in 1910 by Miss
Marie Cromer, a rural school teacher of North Carolina.
Thousands of young girls are now participants
in the new work, each one tending a small
plat of tomatoes and canning the produce for the
market. One girl is reported to have cleared $130
from one season&#8217;s crop raised on one fourth of an
acre. The General Education Board and the National
Department of Agriculture have given liberal
support to this tomato-growing work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
<i>WHAT SCHOOLING SHOULD THE COUNTRY
BOY HAVE?</i></h3>


<p>It is a well-known fact that rural life conditions
have been changing rapidly within the past decade
or more. It has taken us a long while to get away
from the thought that the farmer is to be anything
other than merely a plain, coarse man, comparatively
uneducated and innocent of the ways of the world.
But we are at last seeing the light in respect to this
and many another such traditional belief of a menacing
nature. We are now looking forward expectantly
to the time when the rural community
shall contain its proportionate share of people
educated or cultured in the full sense of either of
these words.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Changes in rural school conditions</span></h4>

<p>Many of those now in middle life can easily
remember when the farmer boy was sent to school
only during the time when his services were not
required for the performance of the work about the
field and the home. This period was narrowed down
to about three months in the year. After the
corn was husked in the fall, he entered school, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
about December first. And at the first sign of
spring, about March first, he was called away to
begin preparations for the new season&#8217;s crop. During
these sixty days, more or less, the growing lad
was supposed to pick up the rudiments of learning
and by the time maturity was reached to have worked
himself out of the ranks of the illiterate. So he did,
for he learned to read falteringly, to write a scrawling
hand, and to solve a few arithmetical problems.</p>

<p>We observe the new order of things. In practically
all the states there have been recently enacted laws
requiring every normal child to attend school during
the entire term and to continue for a period of
seven or eight years. The splendid results of this
provision have only begun to be apparent, but
another decade will reveal them in large proportions.
Back of this new legislation in behalf of the boys
and girls is the new ideal of the possibilities and
the worth of the ordinary human being. We are
just beginning to understand this splendid truth;
namely, that with very few exceptions all of our new-born
young have latent within them all the aptitudes
necessary for the development of beautiful and
symmetrical character. The modern ideal of public
education recognizes two things: first, the right of
the child to the fullest possible development; and
second, the duty of society to see that the child
receive such training whether the parent may wish to
accord it to him or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>The author is especially desirous that the reader
appreciate the situation sketched in the foregoing
paragraph. What does it mean? It means that
our children are at last to have more nearly equal
opportunities of development, that their worthy
aptitudes or traits are to be brought out through
instruction and made to do service in the construction
of a sterling character. It means that we shall have
cultured artisans as well as cultured artists; that the
plain man behind the plow or in the workshop
shall be capable of thinking the big, inspiring
thoughts as well as the little, puny ones. It means
that there will spring up everywhere among the
ranks of those once regarded as low and coarse, a
magnificent society of men and women who, as individuals,
will feel and realize a secret sense of power
and worth, and who will shine in the light of a new
inspiration.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The boy a bundle of possibilities</span></h4>

<p>It has been proved beyond question that the ordinary
child contains at birth potentialities of development
far greater in amount and variety than any
amount of schooling can ever bring into full realization.
If you will make a list of one hundred different
and highly specialized vocations, and pause for
a moment to contemplate the matter, you will
doubtless agree that any common boy might be so
trained as to some degree in any one of the hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
that he might be made to do fairly well in several of
them; and that he might become an expert in at
least one of them.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVII.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_34" name="Fig_34"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxvii.png" width="500" height="365" alt="" title="Plate XXVII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 34.&mdash;Only whittling. But in the case of these country boys it is thought of as not mere
idling, but as a pastime that leads toward the world of industry.</span>
</div>

<p>So, there is little need of being worried over the
thought that the boy is a natural-born dullard,
without native ability to learn and finally to make his
way in the world. It is true that there is occasionally
a real &#8220;blockhead&#8221; among children, but such
cases are quite as rare as imbecility and physical
deformity. Indeed, such cases are nearly always
connected with one or both of the defects just named.
Then, while in the usual instance the child is to be
assumed to possess an ample amount of native
talent, one of the specific problems of his parents and
teachers is that of learning in time what his best
latent talent is, so that it may give proper incentive
and direction for his vocational life.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Classes of native ability</span></h4>

<p>Roughly speaking there are three classes of native
ability in the human offspring: the super-normal,
the normal, and the sub-normal. The first is constituted
of the geniuses&mdash;few and far between,
perhaps one in a hundred to five hundred. The second
is composed of the great mass of humanity upon
which the stability of the race is built and out of
which the geniuses&mdash;and the majority of the sub-normals&mdash;spring
through fortuitous variation. The
third class is constituted of the feeble-minded, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
imbeciles, and the exceedingly rare natural-born
criminals&mdash;altogether, perhaps one in every two
hundred or more of the population.</p>

<p>Now, what we are trying to get at here is a fair
estimate of what the parent may reasonably look
for by way of a stock of native ability in his child.
The natural-born genius will be known by one special
mark; namely, he will be so strongly inclined toward
one special line of work or calling as to need no outside
stimulus or incentive to make him take it up.
Indeed, in the usual case of a pronounced genius it is a
very difficult matter to prevent the individual from
following out his one over-mastering predisposition.</p>

<p>The marks of feeble-mindedness or idiocy are too
well known to need description. Such cases are also
so rare and so special in their manner of treatment as
to call for no extended discussion.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The great talented class</span></h4>

<p>The great masses of humanity are constituted of
what we mean here by the talented. That is, as
described above, at birth they possess a large and
abundant stock of potentialities of learning and
achievement&mdash;much more than can ever become
actualized because of the comparatively limited time
and means for education and training. Of course, we
recognize that among the talented classes there is an
endless variety of combinations of abilities. So are
there many degrees of ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>But in addition to the foregoing marks of latent
ability in the great middle classes we must note a
distinctive feature of the development and education
of such classes. It is this: <i>The two great conditions
necessary for the successful development of the ordinary
child are stimulus and opportunity.</i> Unless the
slumbering talents be awakened by the proper stimuli,
they may slumber on throughout the whole lifetime
and no one detect their presence; and unless
opportunities for development be given to satisfy
the awakened talent, it may return permanently to
its condition of quiescence.</p>

<p>In attempting to furnish the necessary stimuli and
opportunities for the development of his boy, the
farmer has&mdash;if he will only use it&mdash;a great advantage
over the city father. The great variety of
work-and-play experience afforded by the rural
situation, the fairly good general schooling now coming
more and more into reach of all farm homes, the
many conditions contributory to self-reliance and
independent thinking in the case of the boy&mdash;all
these raw materials of stimulus and opportunity lie
hidden about the common country home. But the
parents must themselves become wider awake to the
meanings and purposes of such materials, or otherwise
their value is lost through disuse. And again, it is
urged that parents make the same careful study of
their children as they do of farm crops and live stock.
See the reference lists following the first five chapters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Round out the boy&#8217;s nature</span></h4>

<p>Fortunately, the new provisions of the schools are
furnishing more and more definitely the equipment
and the course of training most necessary for the
masses of the growing children. Fortunately, too,
the illiterate father is not to be permitted to dictate
as to what subjects his boy is to study in the school,
there being not only compulsory attendance, but
strict requirements that every child pursue the prescribed
course. The time is fast approaching when
the rural parent in any community can feel assured
that this course of study has been mapped out by
expert authority in just such a way as to serve the
highest needs of his boy, the idea being to teach and
awaken every side of the young nature into its highest
possible activity.</p>

<p>In the usual case it is a waste of time to attempt
to predetermine the boy&#8217;s vocational life before he has
gone at least well up through the intermediate grades
of the common school; and even then, there is usually
not much indication of what he is best suited for.
So, one of the great purposes of the common school
course is that of sounding the boy on every side and
in every depth of his nature, so to speak, in order to
find what is there, and to determine what he is by
inheritance best suited to do as a life work.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVIII.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="Fig_35" name="Fig_35"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxviii.png" width="600" height="373" alt="" title="Plate XXVIII" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;An illustration of how to keep the boy on the farm. Every boy needs to
acquire early an intimate knowledge of some great industrial pursuit.</span>
</div>

<p>The usual inclination of the rural parent is that of
looking at his son&#8217;s education too strictly in terms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>dollars and cents and to be impatient at the thought
of the boy&#8217;s taking a broad, fundamental course of
schooling. Such school subjects as language and
composition are especially thought of as a useless
waste of time. But fortunately, as indicated above,
the choice is no longer left either to the boy or his
father. The former must pursue the subjects assigned
him and allow time to prove the wisdom of such
a procedure, as it most certainly will. Wherefore,
let the rural father attempt to think of his boy, not
merely as a coming money-maker, but as a coming
<i>man</i>; a man of power and worth and influence in the
community in which he is to live, a man of whom his
aged father in future time will be most proud, and
by whom he will be highly honored.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Other important matters</span></h4>

<p>As suggested above, the evidence is very overwhelming
in effect that it is the duty of rural parents
to give their children a broad, general course of
training as a foundation for efficient life in any place
or position. Moreover, it must not be thought for a
moment that the legacy of money or property will
in any wise furnish a satisfactory substitute for such
a course of training. Mean-spiritedness and narrow-mindedness
are almost invariably prominent traits of
the man who has been prepared to know nothing
outside of his business even though that may be a
big business. On the other hand, extensive culture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
including a character well developed in all of its
essential elements, is by far the best equipment that
can possibly be furnished the boy for his start in
life.</p>

<p>Now, while the growing boy&#8217;s education must not
be especially prejudiced in favor of any particular
calling, there is no good reason why the farmer&#8217;s
son should not be given the benefit of every possible
intimate and wholesome relation to the father&#8217;s
work and business. That is, he must not be forced
to take up the vocation of farming, but he must be
given every opportunity to know its best meanings
and advantages. And if he is finally to leave for
some foreign occupation, he must go with a profound
sense of the possible worth and integrity of the calling
of his father. Then, in order that there may be
maintained most friendly relations between the farm
boy and the farm life, see to it that he has an occasional
outing. Widen the scope of his home environment
by means of sending him outside occasionally.
Let him go off to the state and county fair and learn
what he can there. Let him participate in the grain
and stock judging contests, as heretofore recommended.
Let him attend some of the larger sales
of blooded stock and learn there to know more intimately
the possibilities of animal husbandry. Accompany
him on a trip to the big city occasionally&mdash;under
proper provisions and restrictions&mdash;and help
him to acquire some valuable lesson which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
taken back to the rural community and used to the
advantage of the latter.</p>

<p>Also, what about the literature in the home?
Although a chapter has already been given to the
matter, for the sake of emphasizing its great importance
it is again referred to here. Why not see to it
that there be secured a few enticing volumes of the
clean and uplifting sort? A very few dollars will
furnish the nucleus of a library of which the boy will
soon become proud. Ask the school superintendent
or teacher to make out a list of ten of the best books
for your boy and then secure these at once. Bring
into the home also one or two of the best standard
magazines and keep constantly on the table one or
more of the best and cleanest newspapers. Then, see
to it that the boy&#8217;s life be not so nearly dragged out
during the day&#8217;s work that he cannot spend thirty
minutes or more of each evening at the reading table.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Develop an interest in humanity</span></h4>

<p>All education is for the sake of human welfare.
The thing learned like the material thing possessed
is most worth while in proportion as it serves some
high human purpose or need. There is abundant
opportunity to teach the country boy that education
cannot well exist for its own sake or purely for one&#8217;s
own selfish uses. So it is well early to awaken the
youth&#8217;s interest in people. Have him compare his
own lot with that of others in very different circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>stances.
Take him occasionally to the orphanage,
the industrial (reform) school, the imbecile and insane
asylums, the prisons, and the sweat-shops in the
city. Thus through acquainting him with how the
other half lives you may cause the boy to reflect seriously
on the best meanings and possibilities of his
own life, and to plan in his mind a splendid ideal of
integrity for his own coming manhood.</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s education is not going on rightly if he is
not being introduced to the current affairs of the
world. The literature suggested above should be
made to serve the purpose of bringing his attention
to these matters. He should become interested in
the political welfare of his community, his state, and
his nation, and learn to feel his responsibility in regard
to such things. But he will probably not voluntarily
acquire these better relations to society at
large. It should therefore be regarded as the urgent
duty of the parent to give the necessary guidance
and instruction.</p>

<p>Finally, we must again be reminded of the high
ideals of education and culture necessary to, and
consistent with, substantial country life. The greatest
of producing classes&mdash;the agronomists&mdash;must
and can in time rank at the head of all others in moral
and intellectual worth. So, let the rural parent look
ahead and formulate in his own mind the splendid
vision of his son grown up to full maturity of all his
best powers. Let him see this future citizen as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
man of magnanimity, of splendid personal force, and
of great constructive ability in the important work of
budding up the affairs of the community in which he
is to live.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
<i>WHAT SCHOOLING SHOULD THE COUNTRY
GIRL HAVE?</i></h3>


<p>Perhaps it need not be urged that the country girl
be provided with the same general educational advantages
as those outlined for the country boy, as
the plain demands of justice would mean as much.
She, too, must be thought of as possessing all the
beautiful latent possibilities, and high ideals of personal
worth and character should be constantly
entertained for her in the minds of her parents.
And then, they must allow no ordinary business concern
about the farm home to stand in the way of her
unfoldment in the direction of these higher ideals.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Special problems relating to the girl</span></h4>

<p>Over and above those provisions which relate to
the general development of the country boy there are
several special considerations in reference to his
sister. For example, she has a more delicate physical
organism which must be shielded, especially at times,
against the heavy drudgery that will naturally fall
upon her willing shoulders. And then, the standards
require of her rather more of refined manners
than they do of her brother. Moreover, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
shown that a refined and attractive personality will
become a larger asset in her life than in his. Comeliness
and habitual cheerfulness and numerous other
like qualities must be thought of as necessary and
helpful characteristics of the well-reared country
girl. It will also be much to her advantage to have
some special training in at least one of the so-called
fine arts. Let her have her musical education or
some advanced work in literature or painting. A
sum of money invested in something of this sort while
the daughter is growing may be considered a far
better investment than if the same amount were laid
away to invest in a dowry.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Protecting the girl at school</span></h4>

<p>It is not merely obligatory that the farmer send
his young girl to the district school regularly, and
thus round out her nature symmetrically through
instruction in all the common branches. The delicate
nature of the normal girl requires far more protection
than is often accorded it. Unlike the city
walks and pavements, the country road leading to
the schoolhouse is often menaced by muddy sloughs,
tall vegetation, and deep snow banks. Wading
through such places, especially in bad weather, gives
undue exposure, the feet frequently becoming wet
and the body thoroughly chilled. Many children sit
all day in the schoolroom in this condition. As a
result of the lowered vitality the incipient forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
various diseases enter the body, there perhaps to
return intermittently and with more serious effects
as the life advances.</p>

<p>What may be done as preventive measures, it is
asked. Simply this: Prepare a better road from the
home to the schoolhouse, by putting in foot crossings
over ravines, by mowing weeds and grass, by filling
and draining low places, and the like. On stormy
days and on occasions when the young adolescent
girl is passing through her monthly period of weakness&mdash;one
especially endangering the health&mdash;it will be
advisable to provide a conveyance to school and back.</p>

<p>Country parents also often need to be cautioned
in regard to over-working the school girl. Some even
require her to do practically the same amount of
work as she could well endure were there no extra
burdens at school. Manifestly, this is both unjust
and injurious. Observe the conduct of the young
school girl for a few days. If there is no song and
laughter in her life; if she is not ruddy in complexion
and buoyant of step; if she mopes and drones about
the place; do not censure her, but seek a constitutional
cause and watch for evidences of an over-requirement
of work.</p>

<p>The close inspection of the health of school children,
now conducted in many cities, brings out the
somewhat startling fact that many boys and girls
come to the class room every morning fatigued and
depressed beyond the point of effective study. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
old way was to call them dullards, to punish them,
to shame them out of the school, to humiliate their
parents. The new method of dealing with such children
calls for scientific measures. First, the exact
conditions are ascertained by experts; second, the
parents are urged and helped to provide for the child
more sleep, better food, more fresh air in the living
chambers, more recreation, a relief from over-work,
or some special medical care&mdash;as the particular case
may demand.</p>

<p>If one wishes full evidence of the effective gain for
studentship that results from the new manner of
treatment of the dull and backward pupil, let him
examine the many reports of individual cases as published
in the <i>Psychological Clinic</i> at the University
of Pennsylvania, especially the issues of 1909-1910.
The indifference or the thoughtlessness of country
parents may easily allow for the existence of the
foregoing bad physical conditions in the case of their
own daughter, and as a result her otherwise promising
life may become permanently blighted.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Lessons in music and art</span></h4>

<p>The ordinary farmer needs to learn to take more
pride in his daughter and in her accomplishments.
The time will come when he will be far more proud
of her wealth of character than he will be of her wealth
of material goods. A country father of moderate
means bought a first-class piano for his two girls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
employed a music teacher. &#8220;You may think that
I cannot afford such things,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I can.
I am running this farm for the good it will do my
family.&#8221; He was a true philosopher, as well as a
successful farmer.</p>

<p>It is entirely practicable and most helpful to her
development to provide that the country girl be given
instruction in music, or art, or something special and
advanced in the form of needlework. In its best
sense this special instruction will not be thought of
as vocational training, but rather as a necessary
manner of giving permanent expression to her &#230;sthetic
nature. The author believes that the matter
should be stated even more emphatically. That is,
not to give the normal girl some such means of indulging
her &#230;sthetic tastes is seriously to neglect her
education, if not to do her a permanent wrong.</p>

<p>While vocational training and economic advantages
are important secondary considerations in connection
with the daughter&#8217;s instruction in the fine arts, the
father who helps her become an amateur in one of these
lines thereby renders her a splendid service for life.
It is neither very difficult nor very expensive to
arrange to have the girl go to the near-by town or to
a neighbor&#8217;s once or twice per week where she may
receive competent instruction in music or painting.
To make the arrangement most effective there will
need to be a musical instrument in her own home, a
conveyance at her ready disposal, and a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
allowance of time for practice. No just and affectionate
parents can deny their young daughter any
fewer advantages than these, if the means for securing
them can at all be acquired.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The reward will come in time</span></h4>

<p>The lessons in painting or fine needlework may be
provided for in the same way. If the expense seems
heavy, the far-sighted parents will think of their
declining days of the future and imagine the large
return the daughter may render them through the
skill which they have been instrumental in developing
in her.</p>

<p>But without waiting for old age to overtake them
the father and mother of the girl artist may derive
some benefits from her work. She may furnish the
table service with hand-painted chinaware or adorn
the walls of the home with attractive paintings. And
also, as heretofore indicated, the daughter may herself
in time conduct a class of amateur students of the
fine art in which she has made preparation.</p>

<p>One word of precaution must be offered in reference
to the training here considered. In the usual
case the girl is not started young enough. Her
advancement in the music, for example, is likely to be
much more rapid and her skill much more marked,
if the age nine to eleven, rather than five or six
years later, be chosen as the beginning time. The
author has witnessed many pathetic instances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
adult girls in a desperate attempt to master the mechanical
part of the introductory music. The extra
amount of desire and effort possible at this more advanced
age do not nearly compensate for the better
memory and the greater facility of hand and finger
movement possible at the earlier age. This same
general law of early beginning probably holds good
in respect to the other fine arts.</p>

<p>In relation to all the foregoing seemingly trivial
matters there comes to mind what is perhaps the
most serious problem that confronts practically
every well-reared young woman; namely, that of her
successful marriage to a worthy young man&mdash;a
subject to be discussed at length in another paper.
And so it is contended that if her future happiness or
well-being be a consideration, if the realization of
her fondest hopes and her instinctive desires be
worthy of the thought of her parents; then, they
must by all means see that some of the foregoing
refining qualities become woven into her whole
character during the formative period. Thus she
may be given practically every possible advantage
in finding that true life companion.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The mother&#8217;s office as teacher</span></h4>

<p>In his usual familiar and straightforward way
&#8220;Uncle&#8221; Henry Wallace thus addresses the country
mother through the medium of an editorial in <i>Wallaces&#8217;
Farmer</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>&#8220;It is the mother that shapes and molds the character
of the girl. If she is sweet spirited, looks out
upon the world hopefully and desirous of seeing the
best in men and women, her daughters will as a rule
have the same sort of outlook. If she permits gossip
and fault-finding at the table, her daughters may
reasonably be expected to do likewise. If she sharply
criticises the preacher&#8217;s sermon at the Sabbath
dinner, she need not expect her daughters to become
devout. If she is a poor housekeeper, how can she
expect her daughters to excel in that finest of all
arts? We know something of the depth and tenderness
of a mother&#8217;s love, how earnestly she seeks the
welfare of her daughter; but if she has a wrong conception
of what is best in life, even this unspeaking
affection may be the source of evil instead of good.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the first things you should consider about
that girl of yours is her health. Give her plain food
and plenty of it, sensible clothing, a well-ventilated
and well-lighted room, and all the exercise that she
wants, even if she does seem to be something of a
tomboy; and, barring accidents, she will usually be
healthy through early girlhood. When she begins
to develop into womanhood is the time for you,
mother, to do what no one else can. Tell her about
herself, about the changes that must come, and about
the care she must take of herself if she is to be a
healthy and happy wife and mother. A mistake
here through false modesty is often the source of
trouble for years to come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Home-life education</span></h4>

<p>This book is based on the assumption that every
good young woman is good for something of a practical
nature. In considering the make-up of such a
character, it seems reasonable to assert that no other
qualities stand out more prominently than the trained
ability to carry on successfully the work of the household.
The necessary drudgery of the home life seems
to be the greatest burden that modern society has
placed upon women. Proportionately great should
be the preparation to bear this burden. The ideal
to be realized is, perhaps, not that the girl may be
enabled to do more of such work, but that she may
be trained to be true mistress of it. Woman&#8217;s work
is never done, and it never will be, no matter how
many worthy women kill themselves in an attempt
to finish it. So the greatest thing to be desired in
respect to this unending round of toil and drudgery is
that of a well-poised, spiritually-minded character,
such as may enable its possessor to sit down at the
end of a working period unusually long and in spite
of the confusion and unfinished business restore the
composure and keep in touch with the higher implications
of life.</p>

<p>It is not really a difficult matter to teach the ordinary
growing girl to work and perform faithfully all
of her assigned duties. It is more of a task to teach
her how to quit when she has worked long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and thereby to preserve her health and prolong her
services.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Plate XXIX.</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_36" name="Fig_36"></a>
<img src="images/plate_xxix.png" width="500" height="313" alt="" title="Plate XXIX" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 36.&mdash;These country boys and girls supply the home neighborhood with the produce from the school
garden. Such work is first-class vocational training.</span>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Education for supremacy</span></h4>

<p>It is unquestionably a splendid aid to successful
womanhood for the growing girl to be taught how to
cook and sew and take care of a house. But as a
guarantee of peace and happiness throughout life
she had better be taught many specific lessons in
self-mastery. And it seems certain that the farm
home offers many more advantages for developing a
poised character in the young woman than does the
city home. So let it be seen to by country parents
that their girls be trained from childhood to meet
life&#8217;s stress and storm with calm composure and sweet
serenity. Only such training will suffice to tide the
latter over the great crushing ordeals that tend at
some time to fall to the lot of every good woman.</p>

<p>Conditions in the well-ordered country home may
be made to contribute to another form of self-mastery
in the growing girl. That is, she may be made supreme
over the conventionalities of dress and the
social customs that touch her life. By this it is not
intended to prescribe in respect to such things as the
style or appearance of the young woman&#8217;s clothing.
She may be first or last or medium in the list of the
well-dressed. But it is here contended that she can
be trained to subordinate these matters to a personal
charm that is her very own, and that emanates from a
beautiful and well-poised life within. It is quite as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
destructive to good character for one to be meanly
clothed through necessity and at the same time envy
and despise those who are better dressed as it is to be
among the richly adorned and try to make mere
adornment a mark of better and superior rank in
society, or a means of lacerating the feelings of one&#8217;s
associates.</p>

<p>The country mother will let pass one of the rarest
forms of opportunity for refining and beautifying
the character of her daughter if she does not educate
the latter rightly in respect to these conventionalities.
Train her to be neat and attractive in appearance,
but at the same time teach her that no manner of
outer adornment can cover up or substitute for sweetness
and purity of the inner life. The splendid effects
of such an education will reveal themselves to best
advantage in the young woman when she has finally
entered a home of her own. If she cannot then and
there shine in a light that emanates from her own
soul, the sacrificial work of ministering to the needs
of her own household will never be well performed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">An outlook for social life</span></h4>

<p>Provision will by all means be made that the growing
country girl be introduced to the best social life
within reach. She must mingle with those of her
own age and learn how others think and act. She
must attend parties and the other social gatherings,
especially the literary societies if there be any avail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>able.
For the sake of her training, if for no better
reason, she may be brought into close relation to the
Sunday school and the church. It will be good, indeed,
if she find some congenial work in one or both
of these organizations. Let it be remembered that
the healthy-minded, well-matured woman is very
probably at her best and is most highly satisfied and
contented with life only when she has opportunities
to perform some kind of worthy social service. Farm
parents may well bring it about, therefore, that their
young daughter have some specific deeds of altruism
to perform. Let her carry a small gift or a word of
cheer to the door of the sick or the infirm. Let her
make with her own hands some simple, inexpensive
present to be carried to the one who needs it most and
whose heart will be made glad by it.</p>

<p>Above all things else, it must be provided that something
more than the mere grasping nature of the
young country girl be indulged and developed. Some
there are who still contend that life for men is, at its
best, a game of chance and contention. But such an
ideal, if held up to the growing girl, will tend to check
or destroy all that is best and most beautiful in the
feminine nature. Young women especially must
learn through practice that the best and most beautiful
character is altogether consistent with the performance
of deeds of service and altruism.</p>

<p>Finally, educate into the daughter as much habitual
cheerfulness as possible, let her heart be made glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
again and again, not merely because of what she has,
and because of what she receives day by day, but also
and especially on account of what she gives out of
the best and sweetest of her own nature in behalf of
those whom she may find occasion to help and cheer
on their way over the journey of life. All this will
help to make her a creature of whom not only the
other members of her family, but also the entire community
will be most proud.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<br />
<i>THE FARM BOY&#8217;S CHOICE OF A VOCATION</i></h3>


<p>Turn which way you will upon the great broad
highway of life and there you will always be able to
find the wrecks and broken forms of humankind&mdash;men
and women who have failed in their life purposes.
Strange to say, that particular aspect of the
science of character-building which has to do with the
substantial preparation for vocational life has been
very much neglected. By what rule do men succeed
in their callings and by what different rule do
other men fail? Are some foreordained to success
and others to failure? Is there an inherent strength
in some and a native weakness in others? Is there a
type of education and training which specifically fits
and prepares for each of the native callings? None
of these questions has been thoroughly gone into
with a view to finding out what were best to be done
and what best to leave undone. So, we blunder
away, hit or miss, in the vocational training of our
boys and girls.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Should the farmer&#8217;s son farm?</span></h4>

<p>In attempting to give helpful suggestions to farm
parents relative to their boy&#8217;s vocation, perhaps this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
question will first demand an answer. The tentative
reply to it is this: The farmer&#8217;s son, or any other
man&#8217;s son, should follow that calling for which he is
best suited by nature and in which he will thereby
have the greatest amount of native interest; provided
it be practicable to prepare him for such calling.
Some farm boys are destined by nature for mechanical
pursuits, others for social or clerical work,
others for captains of industry, and so on. Likewise,
the city boys may reveal in their natures a great
variety of instinctive tendencies and interests which
will be found of great worth in guiding them into a
successful life occupation.</p>

<p>Yes, the farmer&#8217;s son should by all means take up
his father&#8217;s business; provided that at maturity he
may have both native and acquired interest in the
same and that to a degree predominating any other
native or acquired interest.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Impatience of parents</span></h4>

<p>It can be proved that the country boy matures
more slowly than the city boy. For example, at the
age of sixteen, he is behind the latter in height, weight,
school training, and sociability. But while the city
boy matures more rapidly, the country boy makes
up for the loss by a longer period of development. It
is the author&#8217;s firm belief that this fact of slow growth
proves a tremendous advantage to the country youth
in that it allows for greater stability of character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and especially for a greater amount of courage and
aggressiveness in form of permanent life habits.</p>

<p>But one might well wish that all rural parents could
realize the evil consequences of being impatient with
the son in respect to his choice of a life work. Many a
good boy yet in his teens is hounded and driven about
by the continuous nagging of his parents, who ignorantly
believe that he should have his future destiny
all planned and ready for its realization. As a
result, this same good boy is often driven to desperation
and to the point of leaving the home place&mdash;of
breaking away from the affectionate ties that bind
him to parents, and of seeking the position wherein
he might earn a living. As a matter of fact, few
young men have any very clear or reliable vision of
their future life at the age of eighteen, or even twenty.
Many of the best men in the world are faltering and
uncertain even as late as twenty-five. However, if
the relatives and friends would only exercise all due
patience, offering only such helps and suggestions
as can be given, and trusting the future finally to
throw upon the problem a light from within the
youth himself&mdash;then, we may be assured, practically
every man will finally come to some line of
effort that will bring him a comfortable living.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What of predestination?</span></h4>

<p>The old-fashioned idea of a boy&#8217;s being marked
by the hand of destiny, &#8220;cut out for&#8221; some particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
calling in life, still has a place in the minds of the
masses. The kindred belief that some men are
&#8220;natural-born failures&#8221; has also wide currency.
A third superstition is the very common opinion
that others are &#8220;just naturally lucky.&#8221; All these
traditional opinions are the outgrowth of ignorance of
human nature such as may be dispelled by means of
a course of instruction, or a carefully arranged
course of home reading, in modern psychology.</p>

<p>None of the foregoing superstitions would be
worthy of our attention were it not for the gross injustice
which they entail upon children. Parents
everywhere&mdash;in both city and country&mdash;are dealing
with their children upon the assumption that one
and all of these fallacies are true. &#8220;My oldest boy
just naturally has no luck,&#8221; said the father of three
sons and two daughters. &#8220;He changes around from
one thing to another and fails every time.&#8221; But
what of this particular boy&#8217;s early training? Was
it the same as that of the others? Did he enjoy
equal advantages? Did his parents when married
really know anything about rearing children? or, did
they really mistreat their first-born through ignorance
and use him as a sort of practice material from which
they learned how to do better by the succeeding ones?</p>

<p>Until the foregoing inquiries about the &#8220;unlucky&#8221;
son&#8217;s boyhood life be fully answered, we cannot
reasonably permit ourselves to condemn him. There
is nothing more in predestination than this; namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
it can be shown that the child is born with not
a few latent abilities&mdash;aptitudes for doing and
learning this and that&mdash;and that one of these
aptitudes is likely to have correlated with it more
than the average amount of nerve development
in the corresponding brain center. As a result,
that particular aptitude will require less training
than the others and will tend to predominate over
them as maturity is approached.</p>

<p>The reply of the psychologist to the statement
that some men are &#8220;natural-born failures,&#8221; is
this: Few if any of those possessed of ordinary
physical and mental qualities at birth are necessarily
so. Excepting the feeble-minded and the like,&mdash;whose
marks of degeneracy are usually apparent to
all,&mdash;it may be asserted on the highest authority
that none are &#8220;natural-born failures&#8221; to any greater
extent than they are &#8220;natural-born successes&#8221;; but
that they have within the inherited nerve mechanisms
many possibilities of both success and failure.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Three methods of vocational training</span></h4>

<p>We should be willing to overlook almost any other
interest in this discussion for the sake of inducing
in the farm father the belief that his young boy is
a potential success&mdash;the belief that this boy is
furnished by nature with the latent ability to shine
somewhere in the broad field of human endeavor&mdash;provided
he be rightly trained and disciplined during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
his growing years. Here, then, is probably the
greatest of all the human-training problems; namely,
the vocational one.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, there have been three methods
of vocational training.</p>

<p>1. <i>The apprentice method.</i>&mdash;First, historically
there has been the apprentice method, the youth
being &#8220;bound out to learn a trade.&#8221; The chief
faults of this traditional way of teaching the boy
to be self-supporting were these: it made no allowance
for intellectual development, and it gave the
father too much authority to choose the calling for
the boy.</p>

<p>A modern offshoot of the old-time apprentice
course is the trade school which flourishes in many
of the big cities to-day. This new institution has one
great advantage over its prototype. It offers such
a great variety of forms of training that the youth
may exercise much free choice. But it preserves
one of the serious defects of apprenticeship in its
neglect of the intellect of the learner. The modern
trade school can never hope to do more than prepare
young men and women to make a good living. It is
a get-ready-quick institution, and can never be
expected to give the student breadth of view and
depth of insight into the great problems of human
life.</p>

<p>2. <i>The cultural method.</i>&mdash;The second-oldest
method of preparing men for a vocation is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
has been called the cultural method. It has aimed
at high advancement in book learning with the
thought of finally enabling the student to enter a
professional class comparatively few in numbers
and supposed to possess a superior advantage over
the great mass of human kind. One fault of this
method has been to emphasize learning for its own
sake and to defer too long the training of the individual
in the material and practical side of his calling.</p>

<p>But the chief fault of this cultural method has been
its contempt for common labor and ordinary industry,
its theory being that true education prepares one to
avoid such practices. If the young man wished to
prepare for law or medicine or teaching or the
ministry,&mdash;one of the &#8220;learned professions,&#8221;&mdash;then
the old classical school was at his service. But if he
would become a mere artisan or industrial worker,
there was no advanced course of schooling available.</p>

<p>3. <i>The developmental method.</i>&mdash;The third and
newest method of preparing the young person for
his vocational life is in reality a compromise between
the first and second. It provides that the learner
shall have book instruction and industrial training
at the same time, and that both of these are to be
regarded as cultural, since taken together they
prepare for independence of thought and action, and
for the vocation, as well. This new method of
preparing young people for their life work would
call nothing mean or low. It aims to serve all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
impartially in their struggle for self-improvement
and vocational success. But its motto is the development
of head and hand together. It seeks
to produce cultured handicraftsmen as well as cultured
artists and professional men.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The farmer fortunate</span></h4>

<p>Our justification for the foregoing somewhat
lengthy discussion of the different theories of education
is that of wishing to be certain of bespeaking
the father&#8217;s patience and forbearance in the preparation
of his son for the vocational life. The
farmer is most fortunate in having ready at hand a
large amount and variety of industrial practice
to supplement the boy&#8217;s book lessons. In this respect
he probably has a superior advantage over all other
classes.</p>

<p>But in guiding his boy gradually toward the
vocational life the farm father can easily mistake
what is merely a passing interest on the former&#8217;s
part for a permanent one. The carefully kept
records of farm boys show that they take up many
different lines of work with great enthusiasm, and
yet soon tire of them and drop them. These serial
and transitory interests are usually mere juvenile
responses to the awakening of some new nerve
centers. They are not much different in nature from
the brief passing interest which the child has in his
various playthings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Now, the chief function of these transitory interests
in special forms of work and learning as shown by
the young growing boy is this: to furnish the
occasions for a great variety of activities and practices
for trying him out on all the possible sides of his
nature. Not one of these intense boyish interests is
necessarily very directly preparatory to his final
choice of a vocation, while all are indirectly so.
Therefore, if the fifteen-year-old son chances to
win in a corn-raising contest, or at a live-stock exhibition,
or if he manifests unusual interest in arithmethic,
declamation, or nature study, do not regard
any of these as necessarily pointing to his best
possible vocational work. Presumably, at such
an undeveloped age, he is still in possession of some
latent interests and aptitudes, one of which may
far outweigh any such thing hitherto awakened
in his life. Give him time to mature and, if at
all practicable, send him on to college.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What college for the country boy</span></h4>

<p>It is the opinion of the author that the State
Agricultural College, as now situated and organized,
is the ideal institution of higher learning for the
country-bred youth. It offers him every reasonable
incentive and opportunity for continuing in the
calling of his father, if he be so inclined, while at
the same time it gives instruction in many other
departments of learning. Whether the state in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>stitution
be a separate one or merely a college within
the organization of the state university matters
little. In either case the young man will be brought
within reach of a course in scientific farming, stock
raising, horticulture, and the like, either to choose
or let alone&mdash;and the so-called cultural work will
still be there for the taking.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The foundation in work</span></h4>

<p>Many rural parents, weighted down with the over-work
of the farm, cherish and express a very earnest
desire that their sons may find some easier form of
earning a living. So they deliberately plan with
the boy the &#8220;easy&#8221; course to be pursued. Said
one such farmer: &#8220;Wife and I decided that there
would not be much in it for Henry except hard work
if he settled down on the home place, so we decided
to send him to college and educate him for something
that offered less work and more pay.&#8221; So they
shielded the son from the heavier duties of the farm
and encouraged in every way the boy&#8217;s thought of
an easy way to success.</p>

<p>But one thing these well-meaning parents failed
to foresee. That is, when the boy entered college, he
began to look for that same sort of royal road to
learning. The assigned lessons and tasks soon took
the appearance of drudgery and he dodged and
avoided them wherever possible. In less than a year
the youth had failed at college and was back home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
&#8220;The confinement of the college did not agree with
his health.&#8221; More than three years have passed
since, and the boy has spent the time drifting from
one &#8220;job&#8221; to another and all the while growing
weaker in character and integrity.</p>

<p>Here we have but another instance of the old, old
story, with its tragic aspects. Yet, nearly all the
faltering, vacillating men now drifting about the
country might have been saved through careful training
in the performance of work. The boy who would
be insured success in his coming vocation must be
required to buckle down to solid work of a kind
and amount to suit his years and strength. He must
learn through the character-building experience of
toil, not only what it means to stay by an assigned
duty till it is performed, but he must also experience
the unfailing joy of work well done. He will thus
have the advantage of the spur of successful effort and
acquire the beginnings of that splendid self-reliance
which is a distinguishing mark of all successful men.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Clean up the place</span></h4>

<p>But there is a sort of drudgery and of ugliness
against which the boy&#8217;s nature instinctively rebels,
and it ought to. By this we mean to refer to the
actual conditions of over-work and the accompanying
run-down appearance that characterizes so many
farm homes to-day. No wonder the boys hasten
away to the city to find a &#8220;job.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>Why not clean up the place by cutting away the
underbrush and weeds, by planting shade trees
and repairing fences and out buildings, by painting
and renovating the house and barn?&mdash;and all
this as an investment in behalf of the children and
their possible future interest in the farm home as
the best place on earth in which to dwell? All
this and more might be urged as means of guiding the
thoughts of the farm boy towards the possibilities
of his taking up the calling of his father. And
while all these material advantages may not serve to
overcome the natural tendency of the young man to
seek a radically different type of occupation, they
will at least make it more certain that his natural
abilities for an agricultural pursuit were not left
unawakened.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Money value of an agricultural education</span></h4>

<p>The College of Agriculture in Cornell University
some time ago made an inquiry into the educational
status of the farmers in a certain county of New
York. It was found that out of 573 farmers, 398
had not advanced farther than the district school,
165 had attended high school one or more years,
and 10 had received a college education. The 398
who had attended district school only were receiving
yearly for their labor $318; the 165 farmers of high
school education were receiving annually $622;
and the 10 who had attended college one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
years were receiving an average of $847 income for
their services.</p>

<p>The foregoing investigation is at least suggestive
in its results. It tends to prove that there is an
actual earning-capacity value in the higher agricultural
education. While the matter has never been
extensively studied, it can doubtless be shown that
the graduates of the agricultural course are receiving
much larger incomes than any of the classes named
above. In addition it can doubtless be shown that
these graduates are better equipped, not only for
earning a livelihood, but for substantial citizenship.
Of course there are many notable exceptions to this
rule, but the rule is, nevertheless, general.</p>

<p>Now, if the farm parent wishes to figure his boy&#8217;s
future on the basis of money-earning capacity, he can
easily be shown that the higher schooling in the
average case increases such capacity. In addition
there is abundant evidence of the fact that the
higher schooling gives the young man a much
better equipment for serving the society in which
he is to live.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A successful vocation certain</span></h4>

<p>Finally, it may be said that the successful vocational
life of the ordinary country-bred boy may be guaranteed
as practically certain, provided he have every
ordinary advantage of development and training
of which he is capable. Train him early in lessons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
obedience and work; make his life more wholesome
through ample play and recreation; see that he
learns how to earn money and how to save a part
of his earnings; provide that he attend the public
school regularly until at least the grammar grades
be finished; give him an opportunity to become personally
interested in the business side of the farm
life; allow him opportunities to mingle with the
cleanest possible society of his own age; and then
await patiently his own inner promptings as to what
line of work he should take up. A college course
may prove necessary in order to help him uncover
deeper and better levels that lie hidden in his nature.
Then, after he has chosen a calling in this careful
and reliable way, with all your might, mind, and
soul encourage and support him in his efforts! This
is practically the only way to make a big, efficient
man and citizen of your boy and to make his calling
a <i>divine</i> calling.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<br />
<i>THE FARM GIRL&#8217;S PREPARATION FOR A
VOCATION</i></h3>


<p>What, may we ask, are rural parents doing in
regard to the careful preparation of their growing
daughters for the vocational life? The author has
frequently asserted that many a farmer is to-day
giving vastly more thought to the question of preparing
his live stock for the money market than to
preparing his girls for their life work. The seriousness,
the well-nigh cruelty, of this situation becomes
apparent only when we inquire into the facts. How
long must this carelessness continue? How long will
farmers remain indifferent to the tremendous responsibility
of giving their children every possible
aid in the direction of a high and worthy occupation?
Their chief concern continues to be centered too
exclusively upon the cattle and the hogs and the corn.
Are the boys and girls to be left to shift for themselves?
And are they to continue to have their
careers determined by mere chance and incident?</p>

work will be required along with the traditional subjects.</span>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">What is the outlook</span></h4>

<p>So, if the country father having a young family
were here before us, we should ask him: What is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>outlook in regard to a happy future for your growing
daughter? Do you want her to take her place among
the men and be forced to do some sort of man&#8217;s work
in order to obtain her bread? or, do you earnestly
desire that she find some sort of worthy woman&#8217;s
work? And if the latter be your choice, what helpful
agencies are you bringing to bear upon the situation?
In the midst of all your consideration of these
matters touching your daughter, we should have you
most earnestly and prayerfully consider at least one
thing; namely, with few possible exceptions, the
healthy, growing girl looks forward instinctively to
the time when she is to become mistress of a household
of her own. And in every case, if the girl fails
to become such a mistress, there is only one reasonable
alternative to be thought of and that is to
provide that she engage in some sort of work which
will give expression in the largest possible measure to
that which is best and truest in her feminine nature.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, in planning for the future of their
daughter, parents might as well consider the problem
as having a two-fold aspect. Assuming first
of all that the girl instinctively desires to preside
over a home of her own, how can she best be prepared
for that place? Second, in case that, by some
miscarriage of plans, she fails to reach this most
worthy ambition, what may she safely fall back
upon as an adequate means of self-support? Now,
if this statement of the matter be a correct one, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
seems that the general scope of the problem of
preparing a girl for her vocation ought to be fairly
clear. Still another way of putting the situation
is this: The girl must be carefully prepared, not only
for her first choice of an occupation, but also for her
second choice, because of grave danger of the failure
of her first choice to be realized.</p>

<p>There is a perplexing aspect of the whole question
implied here, and every parent who has a daughter
should become aware of it and also prepared to
confront it. That is to say, almost any ordinary
man may go out into the open market and push his
quest for a life companion and be able to return
in the course of a very short period with one at his
side. But with the girl it is radically different.
Practically her only stock-in-trade consists of her
personal charm and her pecuniary advantages.
And many a young woman with both of these
qualities very strongly in her favor fails, by some
chance or other, to receive an acceptable offer of
marriage. Statistics widely gathered will show that
age is also a very positive factor in this matter, and
that the ratio of probability of marriage of a single
woman begins to fall very rapidly before she reaches
thirty.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Desirable occupations for women</span></h4>

<p>While there is abundant evidence to prove that
the great majority of normal young women desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
instinctively and above all things else a happy
marriage, including a contented home life and
children to care for, some alternatives must be now
pointed out in case of failure to realize the highest
ambition.</p>

<p>1. <i>May teach the young.</i>&mdash;School teaching is
perhaps the most common, as well as the most
commendable, occupation for unmarried women.
In many a case, the farmer&#8217;s daughter will find it
greatly to her advantage to engage in this occupation
for one or more terms. Thousands of the
most worthy young women in our land are devoting
their lives to this highest of secondary vocations
for women. The work of teaching gives exercise
to the altruistic feminine nature and approaches in
a fair degree the satisfaction which comes to the
mother who is sacrificing for children of her own.</p>

<p>But school teaching wears heavily on the vitality
of nearly all young women who follow it long.
Diseases peculiar to the sex are said to be very prevalent
among such teachers, probably resulting from
an excessive amount of standing. Tens of thousands
of girls are going from the farm home to the school
room, some of them to remain permanently in the
business, but the majority to earn money of their
own and to place themselves in better position for
successful marriage. So, perhaps the first duty of the
country parents to the daughter who takes up school
teaching is to see that the latter&#8217;s health be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
seriously impaired thereby. After that, the young
woman&#8217;s proper advancement in the profession may
be thought of. The ungraded district school is
an excellent trying-out and testing position for the
young teacher. But if she continues many terms
in the school room, graded work will prove more
advantageous, especially in the important matter
of bringing the young woman into the company of
marriageable young men.</p>

<p>2. <i>May take up stenography.</i>&mdash;A vast army of
young women now support themselves with the use
of the typewriter. This work pays slightly more
the year round than school teaching. It is somewhat
more confining; but, for various other reasons, it is
less deleterious to the general health. Such office
business, however, subjects the young woman to
many temptations. It is the opinion of the author
that stenography is not at all a desirable occupation
for the farmer&#8217;s daughter to enter. The continued
absence from home, the constant association with
people differing radically in tastes and manners from
the rural population, not to mention again the many
temptations to accept lower moral standards&mdash;these
and other matters will tend to estrange the
farm daughter from her parents and to make them
feel that something of the former charm of sweet
simplicity and home affection has passed permanently
out of her life.</p>

<p>One thing at least is to be considered before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
daughter be permitted to leave the country home for
an office position. That is, the work is not to be
considered as permanent, but rather as a possible
means of preparing for marriage and the contented
home life that should follow.</p>

<p>3. <i>May do social work.</i>&mdash;Next to the work of
teaching, perhaps the social-service work now being
developed and carried on in the cities would make
its appeal to the true-hearted young woman. Here
again we have a sort of task that dips into the
affections and sympathies of the worker and furnishes
an opportunity for her to give freely out of the
best she has in her make-up. Among the fortunate
considerations of teaching and social work are the
opportunities they offer for the sympathetic care
and guidance of children&mdash;the indulgence of altruism
and the mother instinct in the young woman.
Parents will observe as a rule that their daughter
returns from such occupations as these with increased
affections for the home family and the home
life and a broader and more general interest in people.</p>

<p>In recent years there has developed a new and remarkably
promising field of social work for both
young men and young women. Charitable, philanthropic,
and other social-welfare institutions have
been greatly multiplied, while their work has been
put on a scientific basis. The modern method of
securing employees in such places is that of calling
persons especially trained and fitted to do the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
required, and to pay reasonably for the service.
Several new, first-class schools and institutions for
training workers in this human field have been recently
organized.</p>

<p>Now, if country parents become anxious to have
their daughter go away to the city and find desirable
employment and that at living wages, the author
recommends this new line of social work most highly.
For reasons given above, and for others, it will
prove an excellent stepping-stone to the home life&mdash;the
work is in the general field of human betterment
so inviting to the natural instincts of the well-reared
young woman; the associates are persons likewise
interested in human welfare and ranking high in
moral and religious character; the required work is
usually of a nature to awaken the deepest sympathies
and affections and to make the countenance of the
worker shine with a new spiritual light.</p>

<p>4. <i>May secure clerkships.</i>&mdash;Clerking and general
store work is much followed by young women to-day,
but such work may be put down in the list of hazardous
occupations for women of any age. Close economic
conditions in the cities force many thousands of
girls to leave home and seek clerkships at a wage so
low as indirectly to undermine the health and more
directly to impair the morals. Great armies of these
girls are compelled to live in dingy, cramped quarters,
to subsist on much less than the quantity of wholesome
food necessary for good health, to practice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
strictest economy in matters of dress&mdash;to say nothing
of the constant temptation to sell their virtue as
a means of increasing the small income to the living
margin.</p>

<p>Only in extreme cases, therefore, will intelligent
farm parents consent to their daughter&#8217;s leaving home
to take up a clerkship, and that when her home life
and her social surroundings can be satisfactorily
foreseen and arranged for in advance. Even then,
the question must be raised: Will this new position
probably prove helpful as an introduction to a better
form of occupation?</p>

<p>No other possible occupations for the farmer&#8217;s
daughter will be listed here excepting that of trained
nurse&mdash;a position in which many young women are
doing a splendid service for humanity and at the
same time supporting themselves adequately. But
of course such a position should not be thought of
unless the girl feels an inner call to take it up. Practically
all other outside lines of work for women are
too masculine. Parents should by no means allow
their daughters to take up a life task that means
nothing other than mere money-making. Many
women, it is true, are succeeding to-day in business
callings, but they are doing so as a rule in violation of
certain laws of nature. Many of these business
women are masculine in their dispositions and they
become more so as the unnatural calling continues to
be pursued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A college course for the girl</span></h4>

<p>At first thought it would seem that ability to prepare
a good meal and to do her own sewing might
constitute all the education in household economy
necessary for any young woman. But such proves
not to be the case. There are hundreds of home-making
problems, great and small, for which mere
knowledge of the two important affairs just named
will provide no answer. While the ability to cook
and sew well are doubtless essential characteristics
of the good housekeeper, they are not at all a guarantee
that their possessor is a good home maker.</p>

<p>Parents must learn to take the larger and more
liberal view of the future of their children. Not
merely practice in the culinary art, but also a developed
and refined personality; not merely industrial
efficiency, but also constructive ability of a
social nature; not merely mechanical skill in managing
the details of housework, but a set of well-matured,
effective plans for making the home over
which she presides a place of joy and contentment
for the other members of the family&mdash;these are
some of the evidences of character which the wise,
far-seeing parent might well desire for his daughter.
Now, it is the thesis of this chapter that the normal
woman is at her best only when she has become mistress
of her own well-managed household. But such
an exalted position can scarcely be reached except
through a broad, general course of preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>The one-sided, classical college training has spoiled
for life many otherwise good and happy women.
Such a course tends strongly to draw the mind and
the affections of the young woman away from the
home and from motherhood and other such matters
so fundamental to the well-being of the race. But in
seeking for an ideal school for the daughter the farmer
will find unsurpassed that institution which offers
extensive courses in household art and management,
supplemented fully with work in the so-called culture
subjects&mdash;language, literature, history, sociology,
psychology, and economics. This work constitutes
what might be called a balanced schedule of instruction
for the young woman. If pursued to its conclusion,
such a course of training enriches her personality
and multiplies her opportunities for future
usefulness many fold.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Associations with refined young men</span></h4>

<p>If the young woman&#8217;s preparation for her life work
be satisfactory to all, she must have extensive experience
in the society of young men such as only the
co-educational college can give. As her position in
the rural home has been already too much isolated,
an exclusive women&#8217;s college is least to be desired as
a place to educate the country girl. But the domestic
science course in a state university or a state agricultural
college will be found almost ideal. Here the
girl may be held to a reasonable performance of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
assigned duties, while at the same time she may
mingle freely in the society of both sexes.</p>

<p>Indeed, if the thesis of this chapter be a sound and
tenable one,&mdash;namely, that normally woman&#8217;s highest
satisfaction is to be sought through helping her
attain efficient home life,&mdash;then, there is every reason
for agreeing with the late Professor James in his
contention that every young woman ought to be
taught how to know a good man. It is distinctively
the business of the young college woman, not only to
prepare well all her lessons in household economy
and the literary subjects, but also to keep her eye
out for a suitable life companion. And her father
should be made to realize that her opportunities for
marrying a man of high worth and ability are increased
many fold through the completion of a course
in the ideal form of co-educational college.</p>

<p>Marriages among college mates are usually most
successful, both in the final establishment of substantial
home life and in point of resulting in a reasonable
number of well-reared children. Statistics
gathered widely show that the young woman college
graduate marries somewhat later than her non-attending
sister, that she has slightly better health,
that her children are somewhat fewer, but better
reared.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Make the daughter attractive</span></h4>

<p>It may therefore be urged upon all rural parents,
as a cold business proposition, as well as a duty, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>they take every reasonable precaution to develop in
their growing daughters both an attractive personality
and a beauty of the inner character, whether she
be so fortunate as to attend a good college or not.
All this must be done with a thought of rendering
the daughter as attractive as possible in respect to
any worthy young man who may in time seek her
heart and hand in marriage. It is time for parents
to cease passing this thing by as a mere piece of sentimentalism
and to begin to do the fair thing by
their girls. Why should it longer come to pass in
this enlightened age that some parents break down
the physical health of their girls with the burden of
over-work and thus consign them to a life of moping
and bitter disappointment for the future; that other
parents indulge their girls in the giddy, butterfly
type of life and thus blight their prospects of a substantial
and satisfactory place in human society?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Summary and conclusion</span></h4>

<p>In summarizing and concluding this chapter we
wish to remind the reader of what has been said in
the preceding ones. There are a number of distinctive
elements that must be carefully wrought into
the character of the farmer&#8217;s daughter with a view to
laying a substantial foundation for her future career.</p>

<p>1. First of all, the girl&#8217;s health must be kept in
mind. She must not have an over-burden of work
heaped upon her delicate shoulders, nor must she be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
allowed to expose herself unnecessarily to the inclemencies
of the weather so common in the ordinary
rural districts. There are many women moping
about to-day, ill and despondent much of the time
because of the negligence of parents who permitted
them when growing girls to wade about through mud
and slush and thus impair permanently their physical
well-being. Many of the minor ailments of mature
life recur habitually, and that because they were
permitted to be acquired when the organism was
young and sensitive.</p>

<p>2. The daughter must be taught how to carry on
practically all the necessary details of the housework.
The plain cooking and sewing and the general care
of the home must be required as duties on the part
of every promising girl. It is especially obligatory
on the part of rural parents that they train the daughter
in such a way as to make her a true mistress of
the household over which she may sometime preside.
She must learn through specific guidance how
to subordinate the heavy home tasks to her spiritual
well-being.</p>

<p>3. It is also essential that the girl learn how to
manage the business affairs of the home; especially,
how to purchase the supplies of the kitchen and
the larder in the most economic fashion. She must
also learn both how to secure her own personal belongings
at a reasonable cost and how to make them
serve her real needs without unnecessary expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of money. It will be a great achievement in her behalf
if the girl approach her marriage day thoroughly
imbued with the thought of co&#246;perating with her husband
in the general business of maintaining a home.</p>

<p>4. We would remind the reader again of the necessity
of giving attention to the development of an
attractive personality in the growing girl. Pleasing
manners, refined expressions, neat and attractive
apparel, kindliness and sympathy, frankness and
straightforwardness&mdash;all these should enter into
her make-up and be thought of as parts of her permanent
character. They will also go far toward
winning to her side a suitable life companion.</p>

<p>5. The young girl on the farm should have much
advice in respect to the nature and character of men.
This will be achieved partly through her well-ordered
social life and partly through specific talks from
thoughtful parents. Country girls are probably
less informed in respect to the natures of men than
are city girls. Many beautiful and innocent young
women are led astray either before or after marriage
by evil and designing men; many of them consummate
marriages with men who have an outer appearance
of trustworthiness, but who harbor within some
most serious and insurmountable evil and disease.
Although she may not for a time be conscious of
what her parents are doing, the latter should be for
years purposely engaged in preparing their daughter
to know at sight a good man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>Finally, it may be said that there is no greater
charm or thing of more superior beauty in this good
world of ours than the character of a woman who has
been well-born and well-reared, and who has been
safely guided into the home of her own wherein she
reigns as mistress supreme. In this ideal home the
love and sympathy and the kindly deeds of the true
home-maker will reveal themselves permanently in
the lives of her children and her husband and the
many others who come into contact with her constructive
personality.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />
<br />
<i>CONCLUSION, AND FUTURE OUTLOOK</i></h3>


<p>In concluding this volume we wish again to remind
parents of the necessity of working for specific results
in the rearing of their children. Modern man, unlike
his ancestor, who roamed over the earth, is a creature
of complex and highly refined make-up which no
primitive or natural environment could possibly
produce. The forces that work upon his character
development are so radically different from those
which formed the life of his remote forbears as possibly
to account for the contrasts in the two forms
of finished personality.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence to support the theory
that man belongs to the general evolutionary scheme
of animal life, the progress of the race has been so
very slow that a thousand years of time can show no
very distinct improvement either in physical form or
mental quality. While the human young is exceedingly
plastic as an individual,&mdash;yielding easily from
one side of his inherent activities to another,&mdash;the
race is relatively fixed and stable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Strive for preconceived results</span></h4>

<p>Parents and other instructors of the young must
therefore accept their charges as made up of very com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>plex
potentialities of learning and achievement&mdash;each
a bundle of latent characters transmitted to
him from the ancestral line. Many of these inherited
characters are too weak in any given individual ever
to show in his life conduct; many others will come
to the surface only in response to proper stimuli and
practice; still others will break out and show a predominance
almost in defiance of any training intended
to counteract them.</p>

<p>But the teacher and trainer of the infant child may
accept the theory that the latter, if taken in time, can
be bent and modified many ways in his character
formation; that such plasticity is, however, always
subject to the relative strength or weakness of the
many inherited aptitudes and activities latent within
the individual.</p>

<p>There is no good reason, therefore, why the parent
should not begin early to build up the character of
his child in accordance with a preconceived plan;
provided such plan do no violence to any of nature&#8217;s
stubborn and inexorable laws. The parent may also
accept this task as a long and tedious undertaking,
and expect to get results in proportion as he works
intelligently for them. The farmer does not even
think of producing good crop results from his land
without hard work and much thought; then, why
should he expect so delicate a plant as the human
young to reach satisfactory maturity without much
care and consideration? By far the greatest sin
against the child is neglect of his training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Consult expert advice</span></h4>

<p>We must not be unmindful of the necessity of a
balanced schedule of activities for the child. The
vegetable plant must have air, sunlight, moisture,
nitrogen, and so on, to support its growth. If one
of these essential elements be lacking, the result is
fatal to the fruitage. So with the child. If the best
character results are to be expected, certain essential
elements must be put into use. We have named
them as play, work, recreation, and social experience.
But as one approaches the individual problem of child
training it does not prove so simple and easy as these
terms imply. When and how to give each of these
necessary exercises, how much of each to furnish,
the means thereof, and the like&mdash;these and many
other such questions begin to arise.</p>

<p>When the parent reaches the point of perplexity in
dealing with his child, it is a fairly good indication
that his interest is aroused, at least. But what is to
be done? Simply the same thing he would do at the
point of perplexity in the wheat propagation, <i>consult
an expert</i>. If one of the work mules becomes lame or
reveals a bad disposition, should the owner take it to
an electrician for advice? If the family cow becomes
locoed or shows an unusual result in her milk product,
should one consult a piano tuner? Yet, strange to
say, parents are often known to do similarly in dealing
with the perplexing problems of child-rearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Consult the popular magazines and the book shelves
any day and you will find many lengthy dissertations
on the boy and the girl, written not infrequently by
persons who have spent a lifetime studying <i>something
else</i>. But they are very fond of children and they
mistake this fondness for knowledge of an expert
kind; and worst of all, they offer it as such.</p>

<p>The farm parents who wish to receive expert advice
in the treatment of their children must learn to consult
directly or through literature only those who
have made a long and intensive study of child problems.
And in the latter case they need not expect
to obtain all necessary help from one source alone.
Usually the child-study expert is a specialist in only
one certain part of the field. For example, at the
University of Pennsylvania under Dr. Lightner Witmer,
there has been made a specialty of the sub-normal
child. We should probably obtain from that
source more expert help in that one phase of child
welfare than from any other source in America. If
one wishes reliable help on the subject of diseases of
children, he should naturally expect to obtain it from
some medical authority, from one Who has spent long
years practicing in a general hospital for children.
One of the very few great sources of information on
the general psychology of child development is Clark
University, where many child-welfare problems have
been worked out by experts under the able direction
of Dr. G. Stanley Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Meet each awakening interest</span></h4>

<p>A very reliable general rule of guidance for the
parent child trainer is to strive to furnish intensive
practice for each and every childish and juvenile
interest at the time of its awakening. As stated in
<a href="#Page_12">Chapter II</a> the most predominant interests in the
young emerge in response to the unfoldment of instincts
and the development of organic growths
within. Perhaps all do so. But the point of importance
for the parent is to meet each of these awakenings
at the time of its highest activity with intensive
training. The instinct to play, to fight, to steal,
to run away, to work (?), to fall in love, to engage
in some occupation, to marry and make a home, to
have children&mdash;these have been named as especially
important by virtue of their awakening successively
the individual&#8217;s interests in matters of great
consequence to character development.</p>

<p>But instincts are blind. Their possessor does not
foresee the way they point. They come suddenly
and catch the subject unprepared to direct their force
in what we call intelligent ways. Hence, the extreme
necessity of there being present at the side of the
child, at the time of his instinctive awakening, some
mature and intelligent person who has been through
the experiences the former is about to begin, and who
will sympathetically point the right way and insist
that it be followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Work for social democracy</span></h4>

<p>One can scarcely become deeply interested in the
future of his own child without coming intimately
into touch with the child welfare problems at large.
Even country parents, isolated though they may be,
will discover that serious study of the matter of
bringing up a family of good children will require
that they study the lives of other human young.
Moreover, they will need the use of other children as
&#8220;laboratory&#8221; material for training their own. All
this will gradually lead the way to a fuller social
sympathy in such parents and to the inculcation of
more wholesome social ideals in the minds of their
offspring.</p>

<p>Finally, the rural parents who are seeking a full
and adequate development of the young members of
their own family will most probably see their way
clear to assume a helpful leadership of the young
people of the neighborhood as advocated in <a href="#Page_146">Chapter
X</a> of this volume.</p>

<p>While many agencies for the betterment of rural
youth have been discussed,&mdash;such as the County
Y.M.C.A., the Boy Scout Movement, and the Social
and Economic Clubs,&mdash;the neighborhood which has
at least one of these agencies intensively at work may
be considered fortunate. And it may be said that
such a neighborhood is well on the way to economic
improvement as well as social improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The outlook very promising</span></h4>

<p>Throughout the United States there is being manifested
a general tendency to accept the theory that
our human stock is relatively sound. While there
are seemingly large numbers of the criminal, delinquent,
and dependent classes, they are in reality
comparatively few in proportion to the entire population.
And when we accept the estimate of the
experts that about ninety per cent of the cases included
in the classes just named are preventable through
wise foresight and training, the outlook for a better
race of human beings becomes most cheering.</p>

<p>&#8220;The proper study of mankind is man,&#8221; says the
poet. But for many generations we have regarded
this statement as mere poetry and not necessarily
truth. Our policy up to the recent past has been
rather this: The proper study of mankind is everything
<i>except</i> man, leaving the all-important problems
of child-rearing to the decisions of wise old grand-mothers
and debating societies. But a radical change
has come, and that within this present generation.
Men and women highly trained in the colleges and
universities are now applying their scientific methods
to the study of man with no less zeal and earnestness
than that which has characterized the student of the
non-human problems for many generations of time.</p>

<p>Through the able conclusions of the painstaking
expert the so-called institutional life has been espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>cially
improved. The industrial (reform) schools are
now practicing a system of balanced activities&mdash;of
study, work, play, and the like&mdash;such as the findings
of these investigators have warranted. The method
of paroling the delinquent child, after he has spent
a term of preparation, was proved most helpful
through the careful tests of a large number of cases.
Recently the parole system has been effectively
applied to certain classes of penitentiary convicts. A
most productive agency for good now in use in many
of the prisons and all the industrial schools is that of
building up the waste places in the individual life
through specific training and instruction. The first
question raised in such cases is, What is the particular
moral defect of the individual? second, What
are the causes? third, What will reconstruct his
character and give permanent relief? That is, the
expert psychologist and the expert sociologist are
being called into service with the expert alienist
and physician. The purpose is to save and reconstruct
the whole man. Compulsory education and
trade schooling are now very common in state prisons.</p>

<p>In the care and protection of the insane and the
feeble-minded our country can boast of but slow
progress. Many of the members of these classes are
permitted to run at large and even to marry and beget
their kind. Now, while our human stock is in its
mass very sound and sane, there are constantly being
thrown off from it these mentally defective classes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
The complete obliteration of all such classes to-day
would not result in their complete disappearance from
the race. Others would be born as variants from
normal parentage. But the evil of it all lies in the
fact that we are still permitting many of these defectives
to multiply, and that in the face of the fact
that a normal child has never been reported among
the offspring of two feeble-minded parents.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The modern service training</span></h4>

<p>Of all the institutions contributing to the direct
improvement of the race there is perhaps none
surpassing in importance the modern training school
for social workers. In New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
St. Louis, and other large cities such may be
found usually affiliated with some university or college.
The general purpose is that of training men and
women to go into the field of social service and apply
the methods and conclusions worked out by the research
student. Hitherto, much of the social work
has been conducted by persons possessing merely
religious zeal and enthusiasm. Their efforts were
praiseworthy, but they lacked the training necessary
for coping with modern educational and economic
problems. The distinctive feature of the new methods
is that it is based on scientific and business principles.
That is, the social worker is trained in the
same methodical way as the prospective lawyer or
school teacher, and is also paid reasonably for his
services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>The modern social worker not only proceeds with a
well-defined plan, but he usually makes or requires a
survey of his newly-opened field. The social survey&mdash;now
becoming more common as a means of
beginning a campaign of improvement in the cities&mdash;has
revealed some most interesting, as well as distressing,
situations in the submerged districts. The
housing situation, sanitary conditions, wages and
incomes of different classes, sweat-shop employment,
the protection of workmen in shops and factories,
child-labor conditions, and so on&mdash;these are examples
of the problems of the investigator, while his
tabulated reports serve to guide the social worker.
Now, the duties of the latter are many, but in general
they lie in the direction of improvement of the conditions
as found. Among the undertakings that often
fall to his lot are: establishing new social centers in
congested districts, providing for new parks and playgrounds,
locating reading and recreation rooms,
organizing self-help and home-improvement clubs
among the lower classes, conducting cooking and
sewing schools, and the like.</p>

<p>Of special interest to the rural dweller is the fact
that the modern methods of first making surveys
and then applying remedial agencies is now being
extended into the country districts, giving many
marked results already and promising greater ones
for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The state doing its part</span></h4>

<p>That the nation and the state are active participants
in these new forms of child-conserving and
man-saving endeavor is indicated on every side.</p>

<p>The national government has encouraged the states
in the enactment of stringent child-labor laws. In
the usual instance children under fourteen to sixteen
years of age are prohibited from working away from
home at gainful occupations. Correlated with this
is the compulsory-education law in the several states.</p>

<p>The national and state governments have also
co&#246;perated in the enactment of laws prohibiting the
adulteration of foods and foodstuffs and in enforcing
better sanitation. As a result of such measures, state
and local, together with the help of greatly improved
hospital practice, the infant mortality in several of
the large cities has been reduced more than fifty
per cent in the past decade.</p>

<p>Inspired by the splendid pioneer work of the
National Playground Association, the cities and towns
have recently made very rapid progress in the establishment
of playgrounds and recreative centers for
old and young. Many millions of dollars have already
been expended for such purposes. Now the
country districts are adopting the same means of
social improvement.</p>

<p>The primary system of selecting candidates for
political office is proving to be a most potent agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
for the general uplift. By means of it, better men
are being inducted into office. Better still, the old
corrupt practice of the ward politician, so deleterious
to the character of youth, is losing its once powerful
influence on government.</p>

<p>The so-called social evil, so damaging to the health
and morals of thousands of our best young men and
young women, is now under fair promise of improvement.
The remarkable survey of the Chicago Vice
Commission and the work of the other well-planned
organizations looking to the solution of the same
general problem have proved most effective in revealing
the true conditions and of awakening the public
conscience. All of these activities in the interest of
putting down the sex evils point very clearly one
moral to all conscientious parents; namely, that the
best and most certain method of inculcating lessons
of purity in the case of the young is through preventive
measures, and through the practice of purity
during the years of growth. Open and frank discussion
of the sex problems as they arise normally out
of the experiences of the child, admonitions and prohibitions
in regard to impure associates, the insistence
upon a single, and not a double, standard of purity
for the two sexes&mdash;these are some of the specific
duties of parents.</p>

<p>As an instance of what may be achieved by way of
helping the weak and depraved to defend themselves
against debasing habit, and especially of what may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
done by way of prevention of a character-destroying
habit in time of youth, the Kansas prohibitory law is
cited. The longer this statute remains, the more
effective its work and the more unanimous the public
sentiment supporting it. So popular has this measure
become that no political party and no faction of
any other class has been able to take any effective
stand against it. It can be shown to any fair-minded
investigator that the great majority of the citizens
of Kansas are total abstainers from the use of intoxicants;
also that the state has brought up a new
generation of tens of thousands of men, now mostly
voters, who have no personal knowledge of the use
and abuse of alcoholic drinks and who have become
confirmed as total abstainers for life.</p>

<p>Another unique Kansas measure&mdash;ignored and
derided at first only less than was the prohibitory
liquor law when new&mdash;is the statute forbidding the
use of tobacco in any form on the part of minors.
The wisdom of this statute is supported by the conclusions
of scientific study of the effects of tobacco
on the young. The general purpose of the law is to
prevent the youth from taking up the tobacco-using
habit before reaching full maturity of years and
judgment. The general result will be the gradual
development of a generation of total abstainers from
the use of tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The new era of religion</span></h4>

<p>Even into the sanctuary of the modern church is
the new scientific spirit finding its way. It has become
an accepted principle of procedure among
ministers and other church workers of late that the
best way to save souls is not to depend wholly upon
divine grace, but to assist this subtle power by means
of the constructive work of many human agencies.
Preventive measures that aim at safeguarding the
young against evil contaminations, the institution of
social improvement organizations and of literary and
economic clubs, the formation of good-fellowship
societies, of societies for conducting social surveys,
of committees for giving vocational guidance and for
the administration of spiritual healing&mdash;these and
numerous endeavors of the same class give evidence
of the great service which the modern church is
rendering young humanity. And all this splendid
work is being carried forward without doing any
violence to the essential doctrines of the great historical
institution so long engaged in its serious efforts
in behalf of human salvation.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Final conclusion</span></h4>

<p>As a closing remark the author can only express
again his belief that no past age ever held out such
inspiring hope and such splendid encouragement to
the many parents who appreciate the needs of intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>gent
care and training for their children. And because
of the natural advantages of the surroundings,
country parents have the greatest justification of all
for being enthusiastic over the outlook. Now, let
them go patiently and reverently at the work of
bringing up for the service of the world a magnificent
race of men and women&mdash;men who have brain
and brawn and moral courage and religious devotion;
women who have a profound sense of maternal responsibility,
an inspiring superiority over the perplexing
duties of the household, a deep and far-reaching
social sympathy, and such a poise and sublimity
of thought as to reveal the divinity inherent in
their characters. For lo! In the hidden depths of
the natures of the common boys and girls there lie
slumbering these splendid possibilities!</p>

<p class="title">THE RURAL OUTLOOK SET</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Professor L. H. BAILEY</span></p>

<blockquote><p>Director of the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University</p>

<p><i>Four volumes. Each, cloth, 12mo. Uniform binding, attractively boxed
$5.00 net per set; carriage extra. Each volume also sold separately.</i></p>

<p>In this set are included three of Professor Bailey&#8217;s most popular books
as well as a hitherto unpublished one,&mdash;&#8220;The Country-Life Movement.&#8221;
The long and persistent demand for a uniform edition of
these little classics is answered with the publication of this attractive
series.</p></blockquote>

<p class="title">The Country-Life Movement</p>

<p>
<i>Cloth, 12mo, 220 pages, $1.25 net; by mail, $1.34</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>This hitherto unpublished volume deals with the present movement
for the redirection of rural civilization, discussing the real country-life
problem as distinguished from the city problem, known as the back-to-the-land
movement.</p></blockquote>

<p class="title">The Outlook to Nature (New and Revised Edition)</p>

<p>
<i>Cloth, 12mo, 195 pages, $1.25 net; by mail, $1.34</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>In this alive and bracing book, full of suggestion and encouragement,
Professor Bailey argues the importance of contact with nature, a sympathetic
attitude toward which &#8220;means greater efficiency, hopefulness,
and repose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="title">The State and the Farmer (New Edition)</p>

<p>
<i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net; by mail, $1.34</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>It is the relation of the farmer to the government that Professor Bailey
here discusses in its varying aspects. He deals specifically with the
change in agricultural methods, in the shifting or the geographical
centers of farming in the United States, and in the growth of agricultural
institutions.</p></blockquote>

<p class="title">The Nature Study Idea (New Edition)</p>

<p>
<i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net; by mail, $1.34</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It would be well,&#8221; the critic of <i>The Tribune Farmer</i> once wrote,
&#8220;if &#8216;The Nature Study Idea&#8217; were in the hands of every person who
favors nature study in the public schools, of every one who is opposed
to it, and, most important, of every one who teaches it or thinks he
does.&#8221; It has been Professor Bailey&#8217;s purpose to interpret the new
school movement to put the young into relation and sympathy with
nature,&mdash;a purpose which he has admirably accomplished.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">By D. E. LYON</span></p>
<p><i>Cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $1.50 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Lyon is an enthusiast on bees. He has devoted many years to
the acquisition of knowledge on this subject, and his book is a practical
one. In it he takes up the numerous questions that confront the
man who keeps bees, and deals with them from the standpoint of long
experience.</p></blockquote>


<p class="title">How to Keep Hens for Profit</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">By C. S. VALENTINE</span></p>
<p><i>Cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $1.50 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Valentine is a well-known authority upon the subject. His knowledge
is extensive and accurate; the information that he gives will be
of service, not only to the amateur who keeps poultry for his own
pleasure, but to the man who wishes to derive from it a considerable
portion of his income.</p></blockquote>


<p class="title">Manual of Gardening</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">By L. H. BAILEY</span></p>
<p><i>Cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $2.00 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>This new work is a combination and revision of the main parts of two
other books by the same author, &#8220;Garden Making,&#8221; and &#8220;Practical
Garden-Book,&#8221; together with much new material and the results of
the experience of ten added years.</p></blockquote>


<p class="title">How to Grow Vegetables</p>

<p>
<i>New edition.</i> <i>Decorated cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $1.75 net; by mail, $1.80</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is what it purports to be, a practical handbook and planting table
for the vegetable garden. Its directions for growing in our northern
climate are detailed and explicit, and will be of invaluable assistance
to those who follow them intelligently.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Boston Budget.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The instructions are terse, yet complete, and cover everything as to
method of preparing the ground, sowing seed, cultivation, etc. Practicality
and clearness of direction are the dominant notes of Mr.
French&#8217;s book.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p></blockquote>

<i>Cloth, 12mo, fully illustrated from photographs, $1.75 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Each chapter is the detailed account of all the work necessary for
one month&mdash;in the vegetable garden, among the small fruits, with
the fowls, guineas, rabbits, cavies, and in every branch of husbandry
to be met with on the small farm.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span class="smcap">By KATE V. ST. MAUR</span></p>
<p><i>Cloth, 12mo, illustrated, $1.75 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>The present volume, though in no sense dependent on &#8220;A Self-Supporting
Home,&#8221; is in a sense a sequel to it. The feminine owner
is still the heroine, and the new book chronicles the events after success
permitted her to acquire more land and put to practical test the
ideas gleaned from observation and reading.</p></blockquote>


<p class="title">The Fat of the Land: The Story of an
American Farm</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">By JOHN WILLIAMS STREETER</span></p>
<p><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net</i>
</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Fat of the Land&#8221; is the sort of book that ought to be epoch-making
in its character, for it tells what can be accomplished through
the application of business methods to the farming business. Never
was the freshness, the beauty, the joy, the freedom of country life put
in a more engaging fashion. From cover to cover it is a fascinating
book, practical withal, and full of common sense.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;A valuable contribution to agricultural literature. Not a statement

</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Farmers and other dwellers outside of cities will find Professor Henry
N. Ogden&#8217;s &#8216;Rural Hygiene&#8217; an invaluable treatise on all matters pertaining
to the health of the individual and the community. The author, a
civil engineer in the faculty of Cornell University, deals with the structural
side of public hygiene rather than with the medical side. He tells how
houses and barns should be built so as to promote the good health of their
occupants; how to manage ventilation, drainage, water supply, etc.; how
waterworks should be built, what are the best kinds of power, how to arrange
the plumbing, guard against sewage, and so on. . . . It is an unusually
complete, practical, and readable treatise.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p></blockquote>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he

     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
